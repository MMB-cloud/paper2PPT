And on the other hand, the Nikkei index has significant influence on the intraday return of S&amp; P 500, but not overnight returns. Hamao, Masulis and Ng (1990) employ GARCH model on market indexes of the U. K, U. S. and Japan. They find a spill-over effect of conditional variances from U. S. to the other two, but not vice versa. And they also find that for these three markets, the open-to-close, that is the intraday returns of the foreign markets have significant positive impact on opening price. Lau and Diltz (1994) use the daily opening and closing data of seven Japanese companies‟ stocks that are both listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) andthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), concluding that market barriersthat may prevent information transfer between stock returnsin TSE and NYSE are not significant. And they also tested that two exchange listings do not provide any opportunities to arbitrage. Bae, Cha, Cheung (1999) provide further research in a similar way with a larger sample. They use the data of eighteen corporations and a longer sample period. What‟s more importantly, with a growing concern on thedeveloping markets, they investigate stocks which are dually listed on an developing market and a developed market, with the data the London Stock Exchange (LSE) andStock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), showing that the information transmission between these two markets runs in both ways and that most of the transmissions do not finish overnight and will be continued during the following day."

For example, suppose that company ABC releases its annual report to the market. And it is not consistent with analysts‟expectations a little bit difference per share. Investors will somehowpush the stock price to unprecedented high levels. After several days of trading, the stock price will fall down near to the normal level before the report release, which is the stock's intrinsic valuecurrently.

The amount of individual investors‟capital is not worth mentioning in the whole future markets, so many individual investors pay great attention to operation trend of large funds and pray to make the same position as people or institution with large funds. In addition, individual investors will also change their futures contract frequently in order to make a lot of money. However, it make them unable to establish consciousness of long-term investment and rational investment. Therefore, individual investors‟excessive panic leads them to trade frequently, reducing the investment return and make the market more irrational sometimes."

And then we can take Granger Causality test. The Dickey–Fuller test is named after the statisticians D. A. Dickey and W. A. Fuller, they developed the test in 1979.

In order to make it easier for research, we have to construct a continuous contract. We choose main contracts here, since they are the representative ones with the largest trading volume. For copper, aluminiumand zinc contract in London market, I use the 3-month-long contract. In Chinese future market, we have a strict limitation on the margin system and position, so most investors choose medium-term contract. After checking the trading volume for each contract, we decide to use the contract which will be retired in 4 month for copper and use the contract which will be retired in 3 month for aluminiumand zinc. For example, suppose it is January 2012 now, we will use the copper contract which will be retired in May 2012. And in February 2012, we will choose June 2012 instead.

So we can build a trading strategy according to the performance of London market the day before. It‟s also meaningful to do a trading strategy since the statistical significance doesn‟t necessarily mean the return of the strategy is positive. And by doing a simulated trading, we can find whether there is any arbitrage opportunity or not."

And on the other hand, the Nikkei index has significant influence on the intraday return of S&amp; P 500, but not overnight returns. Hamao, Masulis and Ng (1990) employ GARCH model on market indexes of the U. K, U. S. and Japan. They find a spill-over effect of conditional variances from U. S. to the other two, but not vice versa. And they also find that for these three markets, the open-to-close, that is the intraday returns of the foreign markets have significant positive impact on opening price. Lau and Diltz (1994) use the daily opening and closing data of seven Japanese companies‟ stocks that are both listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) andthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), concluding that market barriersthat may prevent information transfer between stock returnsin TSE and NYSE are not significant. And they also tested that two exchange listings do not provide any opportunities to arbitrage. Bae, Cha, Cheung (1999) provide further research in a similar way with a larger sample. They use the data of eighteen corporations and a longer sample period. What‟s more importantly, with a growing concern on thedeveloping markets, they investigate stocks which are dually listed on an developing market and a developed market, with the data the London Stock Exchange (LSE) andStock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), showing that the information transmission between these two markets runs in both ways and that most of the transmissions do not finish overnight and will be continued during the following day."

And we haven‟t got sufficient evidence that there is overreaction in US future market. J.

And afterwards, the price will retrace to the normal level. Of course the movement can be up and down, when bad news come, the price may drop to a really low level and back to the normal level later. For example, suppose that company ABC releases its annual report to the market. And it is not consistent with analysts‟expectations a little bit difference per share. Investors will somehowpush the stock price to unprecedented high levels. After several days of trading, the stock price will fall down near to the normal level before the report release, which is the stock's intrinsic valuecurrently.

And then we can take Granger Causality test. The Dickey–Fuller test is named after the statisticians D. A. Dickey and W. A. Fuller, they developed the test in 1979. It is used to test whether there is a unit rootin an autoregressive model. We use Augmented Dickey-Fuller test here."

For copper, aluminiumand zinc contract in London market, I use the 3-month-long contract. In Chinese future market, we have a strict limitation on the margin system and position, so most investors choose medium-term contract. After checking the trading volume for each contract, we decide to use the contract which will be retired in 4 month for copper and use the contract which will be retired in 3 month for aluminiumand zinc. For example, suppose it is January 2012 now, we will use the copper contract which will be retired in May 2012. And in February 2012, we will choose June 2012 instead.

Then, during the daytime, there is a high possibility that the price would go down to a rational level. On the contrary, when London market goes down, things happen in an opposite way. So we can build a trading strategy according to the performance of London market the day before. It‟s also meaningful to do a trading strategy since the statistical significance doesn‟t necessarily mean the return of the strategy is positive. And by doing a simulated trading, we can find whether there is any arbitrage opportunity or not."

And on the other hand, the Nikkei index has significant influence on the intraday return of S&amp; P 500, but not overnight returns. Hamao, Masulis and Ng (1990) employ GARCH model on market indexes of the U. K, U. S. and Japan. They find a spill-over effect of conditional variances from U. S. to the other two, but not vice versa. And they also find that for these three markets, the open-to-close, that is the intraday returns of the foreign markets have significant positive impact on opening price. Lau and Diltz (1994) use the daily opening and closing data of seven Japanese companies‟ stocks that are both listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) andthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), concluding that market barriersthat may prevent information transfer between stock returnsin TSE and NYSE are not significant. And they also tested that two exchange listings do not provide any opportunities to arbitrage. Bae, Cha, Cheung (1999) provide further research in a similar way with a larger sample. They use the data of eighteen corporations and a longer sample period. What‟s more importantly, with a growing concern on thedeveloping markets, they investigate stocks which are dually listed on an developing market and a developed market, with the data the London Stock Exchange (LSE) andStock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), showing that the information transmission between these two markets runs in both ways and that most of the transmissions do not finish overnight and will be continued during the following day."

And futures contract price react more strongly to bad news than good news. Haiwei Chen (1998) study 19 future contracts in US futures market, he concludes that it is hard to conclude whether there is overreaction or not and the results depend on the standard. And we haven‟t got sufficient evidence that there is overreaction in US future market. J. Barry Lin (1999) studies the daytime price reversal in the US futures market, he finds the universal existence of profit reversal, and he concludes that overreaction exists in US future market. Changyun Wang and Min Yu(2004) studied weekly price inversion phenomenon in US future market, they find that thephenomenon is significant when holding period is one week, while the phenomenon is not significant when holding period is two, four and eight weeks. They conclude that overreaction phenomenon occurs in US future market in short period."

Instead, there is under reaction. Zhou and Tang(2006) use event study method to test whether overreaction phenomenon occurs in Chinese futures market. They find that overreaction to good or bad news did not occur in Chinese commodity future markets and aluminium in one month and rubber in three month under reaction to good news. Jiang and Wu (2007) do a research on five major products (Shanghai copper, Shanghai aluminium, Shanghai rubber, Dalian soybean, Zhengzhou wheat) in Chinese commodity futuresmarket. They find that no matter good news sample or bad news sample, all the five products‟reverse trading strategy cannot get significant returns.

Overreaction happens when certain good new information release in a security market, it causes big movement of the price, which is higher than its true value. And afterwards, the price will retrace to the normal level. Of course the movement can be up and down, when bad news come, the price may drop to a really low level and back to the normal level later. For example, suppose that company ABC releases its annual report to the market. And it is not consistent with analysts‟expectations a little bit difference per share. Investors will somehowpush the stock price to unprecedented high levels. After several days of trading, the stock price will fall down near to the normal level before the report release, which is the stock's intrinsic valuecurrently.

And then we can take Granger Causality test. The Dickey–Fuller test is named after the statisticians D. A. Dickey and W. A. Fuller, they developed the test in 1979. It is used to test whether there is a unit rootin an autoregressive model. We use Augmented Dickey-Fuller test here."

For copper, aluminiumand zinc contract in London market, I use the 3-month-long contract. In Chinese future market, we have a strict limitation on the margin system and position, so most investors choose medium-term contract. After checking the trading volume for each contract, we decide to use the contract which will be retired in 4 month for copper and use the contract which will be retired in 3 month for aluminiumand zinc. For example, suppose it is January 2012 now, we will use the copper contract which will be retired in May 2012. And in February 2012, we will choose June 2012 instead.

Then, during the daytime, there is a high possibility that the price would go down to a rational level. On the contrary, when London market goes down, things happen in an opposite way. So we can build a trading strategy according to the performance of London market the day before. It‟s also meaningful to do a trading strategy since the statistical significance doesn‟t necessarily mean the return of the strategy is positive. And by doing a simulated trading, we can find whether there is any arbitrage opportunity or not."

On one hand, because of the reasons we have mentioned above, future prices of the  same commodity all over the world share the similar related information, like supply and demand. It is reasonable to believe future price has interactive relationship between the domestic futures market and the international futures market. On the other hand, the prices also depend on the different standards of underlying asset, the specific design of the futures contracts and rules of transactions and delivery. What‟s more important, the world‟s market is surly not fully open and completely competed.

The price of copper and aluminium traded in the Shanghai Future Exchange (SHFE) is co-integrated with the ones traded in the London Metal Exchange (LME).

And on the other hand, the Nikkei index has significant influence on the intraday return of S&amp; P 500, but not overnight returns. Hamao, Masulis and Ng (1990) employ GARCH model on market indexes of the U. K, U. S. and Japan. They find a spill-over effect of conditional variances from U. S. to the other two, but not vice versa. And they also find that for these three markets, the open-to-close, that is the intraday returns of the foreign markets have significant positive impact on opening price. Lau and Diltz (1994) use the daily opening and closing data of seven Japanese companies‟ stocks that are both listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) andthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), concluding that market barriersthat may prevent information transfer between stock returnsin TSE and NYSE are not significant. And they also tested that two exchange listings do not provide any opportunities to arbitrage. Bae, Cha, Cheung (1999) provide further research in a similar way with a larger sample. They use the data of eighteen corporations and a longer sample period. What‟s more importantly, with a growing concern on thedeveloping markets, they investigate stocks which are dually listed on an developing market and a developed market, with the data the London Stock Exchange (LSE) andStock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), showing that the information transmission between these two markets runs in both ways and that most of the transmissions do not finish overnight and will be continued during the following day."

Overreaction happens when certain good new information release in a security market, it causes big movement of the price, which is higher than its true value. And afterwards, the price will retrace to the normal level. Of course the movement can be up and down, when bad news come, the price may drop to a really low level and back to the normal level later. For example, suppose that company ABC releases its annual report to the market. And it is not consistent with analysts‟expectations a little bit difference per share. Investors will somehowpush the stock price to unprecedented high levels. After several days of trading, the stock price will fall down near to the normal level before the report release, which is the stock's intrinsic valuecurrently.

So before Granger Causality test, we need to do a unit root test to see whether there‟s unit root in a time series data. If there is no unit root, it means this series is stationary. And then we can take Granger Causality test. The Dickey–Fuller test is named after the statisticians D. A. Dickey and W. A. Fuller, they developed the test in 1979. It is used to test whether there is a unit rootin an autoregressive model. We use Augmented Dickey-Fuller test here."

For copper, aluminiumand zinc contract in London market, I use the 3-month-long contract. In Chinese future market, we have a strict limitation on the margin system and position, so most investors choose medium-term contract. After checking the trading volume for each contract, we decide to use the contract which will be retired in 4 month for copper and use the contract which will be retired in 3 month for aluminiumand zinc. For example, suppose it is January 2012 now, we will use the copper contract which will be retired in May 2012. And in February 2012, we will choose June 2012 instead.
