Take the author‘s school as an example, there‘s only one professional English teacher for all  the pupils in 16 classes from Grade 3 to Grade 6 before the author go to do the connective English teaching between elementary schools and junior high schools. During the first year‘s connective English teaching between elementary schools and junior high schools, the author found pupils were totally poor in English. The biggest problem is that most of them can‘t recognize or read what they had learnt in their PEP English textbooks. Thus it was really difficult for them to read the simple stories or short passages appeared in each unit in the PEP English textbook of Grade Six. And it seemed  difficult  for  them  to  answer  simple  questions  like  ―Yes‖  or  ―No‖  questions because they couldn‘t catch what they read."

As time went by, the United States educators who heard about the development of peer teaching with quite a lot of efficiency and effectiveness adopted this teaching method. In the 1960s, peer education programs were implemented in many U. S. schools. Since then, extensive penetration of peer education programs were implemented both inside and outside the classroom from primary school to university, from the most popular math, language lessons, to music, art class, and even on Internet."

PALS is a version of class wide peer tutoring. Teachers identify which children require help on specific skills and who the most appropriate children are to help other children learn those skills. Using this information, teachers pair students in the class, so that partners work simultaneously and productively on different activities that address the problems they are experiencing. Pairs are changed regularly, and over a period of time as students work on a variety of skills, all students have  the  opportunity to  be ―coaches‖ and ―players‖. Many structured  reading activities such as Reading aloud with Retelling, Paragraph Shrinking and Prediction Relay are carefully designed to improve students' reading skills to (a) cumulatively review information read, (b) sequence information, (c) summarize paragraphs and pages, (d) state main ideas in as few words as possible, and (e) predict and check outcomes (Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995). Since 1980s, PALS programs have been conducted worldwide and extended from kindergarten to high school. A large number of evidence suggests that interacting in this type of classwide peer tutoring improves students' achievement (e. g. Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995; Mastropieri, et al., 2001; McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006; Topping, 2005). Findings of PALS research include more academic time on tasks, academic and social growth, friendship among students, positive affective attitudes toward learning, and  feasibility for implementation. Hence, PALS  was  awarded ―Best Practice‖status from the U. S Department of Education Program Effectiveness Panel (McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006)."

PT is an approach based on peer mediated instruction, whereby children take turns to be tutors or tutees and work together to support each other's learning. An advantage of peer mediation is that subgroups of children in the same classroom can operate on different levels of curricula and use different instructional procedures. Teachers, in effect, can oversee many lessons simultaneously and address a broader range of students' educational needs, including those of many English-language learners and students with disabilities. Research in the elementary grades shows that children's reading competence improves when they work with each other in a cooperative and structured manner (e. g., Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989; Rosenshine &amp; Meister, 1994; Stevens, Madden, Slavin, &amp; Famish, 1987). It is clear that PT has striking advantages compared with CL. Firstly, students learn together in the smallest group of two members in the way of PT. Dyads of students can communicate and understand each other well and soon get accustomed to the learning procedures. Secondly, each student benefits from preparing to teach another student for PT is reciprocal, enabling each student to assume both roles of tutor and tutee. Study evidence shows that classroom-based reciprocal tutoring can effectively increase students' academic productivity and course self-satisfaction (Wolfe, Fantuzzo, &amp; Wolfe, 1986). Research on PT illustrates its efficacy in learning because it (a) increases students' academic and social development, (b) promotes students' positive intrinsic motivation and enhances cognitive skills within participating and reciprocal peers, (c) improves tutors' interpersonal and communicative skills, and (d) increases students' task"

In traditional classroom teaching, pupils are required to work individually most of the time. They listen to the teacher, follow the tape, answer some questions together and complete assignments, focusing on their own interest and ignoring the success or failure of others. According to Johnson &amp; Johnson (1994), in peer interactions, pupils can acquire attitudes, values, skills and information which are unobtainable from adults. Peer interaction prepares pupils for models of social behavior and peer relationships help kill loneliness and build up a sense of belonging among community. Peers benefit from the productivity and efficiency through their interdependence."

Later Bell found that this is a very important teaching method. To further promote the burgeoning development of this new teaching method, his school made significant adjustments. According to students' academic placement, they put higher students in a higher-level class and lower students in a lower-level class. Bell also made half students of each class teachers (tutors) and the other half students (tutees) to accept the help of tutors. Meanwhile, teachers and teaching assistants inspected here and there to help children, to monitor children and to evaluate those tutors and tutees to ensure the effectiveness of this teaching system."

S. schools and universities. These researches differ in whether the tutor is of similar age as the tutee and whether the tutor's and tutee's responsibilities are reciprocal. The programs have differed, too, in term of structure (high vs. low), setting (classroom vs. special education), intensity (e. g., one 15-min. sessiom per week vs. five45-min. sessions per week), time of day (during school vs. after school), targeted domain (personal/social vs. academic), scope (e. g., supplementing the curriculum vs. supplanting the curriculum), and so forth (Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, &amp; Simmon, 1997).

No studies of PALS have been found  to investigate its effects on students in a foreign context. In China, research on PALS has been limited to theoretical introduction and discussion. Seldom have the researchers tried PALS procedures in regular classrooms to examine its effectiveness in reading teaching. Therefore, the present study is aimed at bridging the research gap by examining PALS effects on reading performance in the China-specific primary school."

Additionally, there have been PALS evaluations conducted by educators in California, Iowa, and Texas independent of Vanderbilt researchers.

In addition, the PALS programs are practical and are enjoyed by teachers and students. PALS has several crucial features. First, with PALS, every student in the class is paired. In each pair, one student is academically stronger than the other. During each PALS session, the students in a pair take turns as tutor and tutee while working on structured activities that address the difficulties each may be experiencing. This pairing creates 10 to 15 instructional experiences in a given classroom, each geared to individual needs. Second, it also permits the teacher to circulate in the class, to observe students, and to provide individual help as needed. Third, activities focus on key skills in reading and target the development of fluency and reading comprehension and reflect state-of-the-art instructional practices. Fourth, here is a structured reinforcement system in PALS. Elementary school pupils are assigned to a team and earn points. The winning team wins the class' applause and the teacher's praise. For high-school students, PALS offers tangible reinforces such as CDs, local sports-team apparel, and fast-food coupons (Gu Hongyan, 2010). So PALS motivates students to do better in reading and is found to be enjoyable by teachers and students. Finally, PALS does not provide any reading material for students in grades 2-6 or high school because it is a kind of curriculum-based reading program. It is the teacher's responsibility to select appropriate reading materials. For example, teachers have used PLAS-Reading as effectively with whole language instruction as with phonics-based approaches. PALS enhances teachers' ongoing practices (PALS Brochure, 2011). So it has feasibility and is meaningful in China."

Another important representative Vygotsky (1978), also pointed out that learning is ―social construction‖. The role of cultural and historical background influences the cognitive development of learners. Activities and social interaction both play an important role in the development of high-level mental."

It is through the mediation of others that the child undertakes activities (Vygotsky, 1978). Williams&amp; Burden (2000) defined mediation as the part played by significant others in the learners' lives, who enhance their learning by selecting and shaping the learning experiences presented to them. PALS makes good use of this theory and successfully make the tutor and tutee be the significant others for each other by creating reciprocal tutoring roles in the strategic activities. In each session, the higher performing student reads first for each activity to model desired performance. Both students in a pair read from material appropriate for the lower reader. As observed by Damon and Phelps (Damon, W., and Phelps, E., 1988), in the peer teaching, irrespective of the professional knowledge, teaching ability, or authority, there's little gap between the helper and the helped. It is the little gap that has a significant impact on the dialogues occurred during the interaction. The tutor, who is not as an expert or a teacher, doesn't teach like the teachers or put the tutee in a place of passive position. Hence, the reciprocal tutoring roles dare to ask questions and have the courage to try to solve the problems. They both learn by teaching and complete the construction of knowledge."

Vygotsky (1978) argued that one cannot fully understand children's developmental level without examining that development's upper boundary, which is determined by the kind of tasks that that children can do with assistance of someone else. The ZPD is a dialectical unity of learning-and-development, or more appropriately, learning-leading-development (Newman&amp; Holzman, 1993). In this unity, all kinds of higher mental activities, including thinking, planning, voluntary memory, voluntary attention, creativity and control of semiotic systems (especially language), will arise in the interaction between children and other members. So, the concept of ZPD highly underpins the necessity of interaction and collaboration with more skilled mediators."

As long as LAD receives and comprehends input containing linguistic features at i+1, the learner can acquire the language successfully, whether the person participates in linguistic interaction with others does not matter. Hence, according to Krashen, interaction is more or less irrelevant to language acquisition. However, Krashen acknowledges that two-way interaction in which meaning is negotiated through clarification requests and confirmation checks can help promote the acquisition process of language (Krashen, 1985). In this way, language is used as a way of communication in the acquisition process. The message is transmitted as output from one place and received as input elsewhere. When language users have difficulty in understanding each other, they will convey their meanings in a more comprehensible way by repeating a message verbatim, adjusting its syntax, changing its words, or modifying its form and meaning, and so on. Thus, the activity of negotiation during which language users receive comprehensible input and produce comprehensible output contributes to second language learning."

Teaching materials were applied from the reading part of Go for it students' book for Junior Three published by People's Education Press, which is also students' core course. Since each unit in Go for it for Junior Three consists of Section A, Section B and Reading, there're at least three to four passages for students to read each week. So the researcher applied PALS when it was time to give students reading teaching. Because of limited class time for Junior Three students and their graduation, PALS programs were implemented 2 times a week for nearly one school year; and each session lasted 45 minutes. During the process the researcher visited the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center at http: //kc. vanderbilt. edu/pals/ consequently to adjust some strategies. Also the researcher took pluralistic evaluation on the students' performance during using PALS (Appendix 1). Reading scores in the monthly test before treatment and in the model entrance exams after treatment were collected and analyzed.

Students believed that PALS provided more opportunities for reading learning and created a relaxing class atmosphere among their hard learning process in Junior Three. They thought PALS made English learning interesting and competitive. Based on the experience of the study, the researcher wrote a paper Making the Students Enjoy Reading in 2009 and won the second prize in the teaching thesis competition of Zhejiang province in 2010 (Appendix 1)."

The materials are chosen from PEP Primary English Book for Grade Six which is published by People's Education Press. The materials and tests are required by the new English curriculum criterion for the students entering the experiment. The data gained from the four classes includes pre-test and final-test. Because of the prior successful research in Junior Three students, the researcher assumes that PALS will help students of all levels make progress in English. PALS was applied for all the four classes and there is no control group. What the researcher wants to do is to compare the students' reading comprehension performance and their changes in English in the both tests and discuss the effect of PALS on pupils of Grade Six."

Wu1, the highest-performing student of the top half was paired with Liu2, the highest-performing student of the bottom half.

Chen is left single as there are 35 students in total in Class Three, so Chen is assigned with a pair who sit nearby him according to his willing.

In fact, the pupils, even the low-achieving ones, would be very active to be tutor first on condition that they had previewed the texts.

During the reading aloud process, the pupils' roles are reciprocal because they take turns to be reader and tutor. The teacher guides the pupils to focus on the pronunciation of some difficult words such as country, always, drive, England, Australia, and however.

These questions include some easy common ones used for interaction such as―What did you learn first‖，―whatdidyoulearnnext‖，―Could you please tell me…‖, andso on.

The total number of the pupils who took part in the test is 145, with one pupil's score missing because of learning disability, and the researcher will analyze his performance separately (see Section 4.1.3). The total marks for reading is 25. The segmentation is determined according to the standard of the evaluation for primary pupils used by Shangcheng Teaching Evaluation Department. In total, 87 pupils, over half of the grade, were low achieving in reading with the scores 0-14 out of 25. 54 pupils were average achieving with the sores from 15 to 21 and only 3 pupils (6.67%) were high achieving out of 144 students in the whole grade. It suggested that the pupils of the whole grade were very poor in English reading. In every class, more than half of the pupils were low achieving in reading. Things were worst in Class 4, with"

Though most students from migrant workers' families work hard, it is a fact that they do poor in English learning, partly because of their different accent and partly because of their backward foundation in English, since most of them didn't learn English before they came to Hangzhou. And compared with other native students in Hangzhou, they didn't spent much time in learning English, either. In some pilot research, the researcher once made some interview on students' English learning after school. The gathered information shows in the researcher's school, most students can't offer the money to learn English in some language schools like most native ones in other schools do. Some students need to help their family deal with business. And some even need to be babysitter after school to take care of their younger sisters or brothers. Thus, there's always great gap in learning quality between the researcher's school and the whole district. However, Table 4.7 showed that the gap, irrespective of that between mean score, excellent rate or pass rate, was comprehensively shortened after a semester's experiment with the mean score gap changing from -11.13 to -7.02, the excellent rate changing from -27.88 to -18.39, and the pass rate changing from -18.00 to -5.95. Among them, the pass rate increased fastest."

Firstly, students were really weak in reading aloud, knowing little of phonetic principles because they were paid little attention in most traditional classes, though there is much practice on it in PEP English books. In peer activities, students got more chances to practice reading in class. Secondly, timely feedback from the teacher or a tutor contributed to the improvement. Finally, as the improvement of reading aloud could be detected over a short period of time and points could easily be gained through reading, pupils thought this activity more meaningful."

Take the author‘s school as an example, there‘s only one professional English teacher for all  the pupils in 16 classes from Grade 3 to Grade 6 before the author go to do the connective English teaching between elementary schools and junior high schools. During the first year‘s connective English teaching between elementary schools and junior high schools, the author found pupils were totally poor in English. The biggest problem is that most of them can‘t recognize or read what they had learnt in their PEP English textbooks. Thus it was really difficult for them to read the simple stories or short passages appeared in each unit in the PEP English textbook of Grade Six. And it seemed  difficult  for  them  to  answer  simple  questions  like  ―Yes‖  or  ―No‖  questions because they couldn‘t catch what they read."

PALS is a version of class wide peer tutoring. Teachers identify which children require help on specific skills and who the most appropriate children are to help other children learn those skills. Using this information, teachers pair students in the class, so that partners work simultaneously and productively on different activities that address the problems they are experiencing. Pairs are changed regularly, and over a period of time as students work on a variety of skills, all students have  the  opportunity to  be ―coaches‖ and ―players‖. Many structured  reading activities such as Reading aloud with Retelling, Paragraph Shrinking and Prediction Relay are carefully designed to improve students' reading skills to (a) cumulatively review information read, (b) sequence information, (c) summarize paragraphs and pages, (d) state main ideas in as few words as possible, and (e) predict and check outcomes (Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995). Since 1980s, PALS programs have been conducted worldwide and extended from kindergarten to high school. A large number of evidence suggests that interacting in this type of classwide peer tutoring improves students' achievement (e. g. Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995; Mastropieri, et al., 2001; McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006; Topping, 2005). Findings of PALS research include more academic time on tasks, academic and social growth, friendship among students, positive affective attitudes toward learning, and  feasibility for implementation. Hence, PALS  was  awarded ―Best Practice‖status from the U. S Department of Education Program Effectiveness Panel (McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006)."

PT is an approach based on peer mediated instruction, whereby children take turns to be tutors or tutees and work together to support each other's learning. An advantage of peer mediation is that subgroups of children in the same classroom can operate on different levels of curricula and use different instructional procedures. Teachers, in effect, can oversee many lessons simultaneously and address a broader range of students' educational needs, including those of many English-language learners and students with disabilities. Research in the elementary grades shows that children's reading competence improves when they work with each other in a cooperative and structured manner (e. g., Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989; Rosenshine &amp; Meister, 1994; Stevens, Madden, Slavin, &amp; Famish, 1987). It is clear that PT has striking advantages compared with CL. Firstly, students learn together in the smallest group of two members in the way of PT. Dyads of students can communicate and understand each other well and soon get accustomed to the learning procedures. Secondly, each student benefits from preparing to teach another student for PT is reciprocal, enabling each student to assume both roles of tutor and tutee. Study evidence shows that classroom-based reciprocal tutoring can effectively increase students' academic productivity and course self-satisfaction (Wolfe, Fantuzzo, &amp; Wolfe, 1986). Research on PT illustrates its efficacy in learning because it (a) increases students' academic and social development, (b) promotes students' positive intrinsic motivation and enhances cognitive skills within participating and reciprocal peers, (c) improves tutors' interpersonal and communicative skills, and (d) increases students' task"

They listen to the teacher, follow the tape, answer some questions together and complete assignments, focusing on their own interest and ignoring the success or failure of others. According to Johnson &amp; Johnson (1994), in peer interactions, pupils can acquire attitudes, values, skills and information which are unobtainable from adults. Peer interaction prepares pupils for models of social behavior and peer relationships help kill loneliness and build up a sense of belonging among community.

He first made―little teacher‖(child monitor) strategy for the full use of children teaching children to reduce costs and save the need for school expenses. Later Bell found that this is a very important teaching method. To further promote the burgeoning development of this new teaching method, his school made significant adjustments. According to students' academic placement, they put higher students in a higher-level class and lower students in a lower-level class. Bell also made half students of each class teachers (tutors) and the other half students (tutees) to accept the help of tutors. Meanwhile, teachers and teaching assistants inspected here and there to help children, to monitor children and to evaluate those tutors and tutees to ensure the effectiveness of this teaching system."

It was an afterschool program implemented in Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey (Gerber &amp; Kauffman, 1981). Since then, many forms of peer tutoring programs have been implemented in many U. S. schools and universities. These researches differ in whether the tutor is of similar age as the tutee and whether the tutor's and tutee's responsibilities are reciprocal. The programs have differed, too, in term of structure (high vs. low), setting (classroom vs. special education), intensity (e. g., one 15-min. sessiom per week vs. five45-min. sessions per week), time of day (during school vs. after school), targeted domain (personal/social vs. academic), scope (e. g., supplementing the curriculum vs. supplanting the curriculum), and so forth (Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, &amp; Simmon, 1997). Several meta-analyses of peer tutoring studies indicate that peer tutoring can contribute to students' school achievement (e. g., Cohen,"

Each pair includes a higher and lower performer. The teacher creates the pairings by ranking the class on reading competence, halving the rankings at the median, and combining the highest performer from the top half with the highest performer from the bottom half and so on till the pairing is done (Fuchs, Douglas; Fuchs, Lynn S., 2005). Pairs are changed regularly (e. g. ever 3-4 weeks), and over a period of time as students work on a variety of skills, all students have the opportunity to be―coaches‖and―players‖."

In addition, the PALS programs are practical and are enjoyed by teachers and students. PALS has several crucial features. First, with PALS, every student in the class is paired. In each pair, one student is academically stronger than the other. During each PALS session, the students in a pair take turns as tutor and tutee while working on structured activities that address the difficulties each may be experiencing. This pairing creates 10 to 15 instructional experiences in a given classroom, each geared to individual needs. Second, it also permits the teacher to circulate in the class, to observe students, and to provide individual help as needed. Third, activities focus on key skills in reading and target the development of fluency and reading comprehension and reflect state-of-the-art instructional practices. Fourth, here is a structured reinforcement system in PALS. Elementary school pupils are assigned to a team and earn points. The winning team wins the class' applause and the teacher's praise. For high-school students, PALS offers tangible reinforces such as CDs, local sports-team apparel, and fast-food coupons (Gu Hongyan, 2010). So PALS motivates students to do better in reading and is found to be enjoyable by teachers and students. Finally, PALS does not provide any reading material for students in grades 2-6 or high school because it is a kind of curriculum-based reading program. It is the teacher's responsibility to select appropriate reading materials. For example, teachers have used PLAS-Reading as effectively with whole language instruction as with phonics-based approaches. PALS enhances teachers' ongoing practices (PALS Brochure, 2011). So it has feasibility and is meaningful in China."

Another important representative Vygotsky (1978), also pointed out that learning is ―social construction‖. The role of cultural and historical background influences the cognitive development of learners. Activities and social interaction both play an important role in the development of high-level mental."

It is through the mediation of others that the child undertakes activities (Vygotsky, 1978). Williams&amp; Burden (2000) defined mediation as the part played by significant others in the learners' lives, who enhance their learning by selecting and shaping the learning experiences presented to them. PALS makes good use of this theory and successfully make the tutor and tutee be the significant others for each other by creating reciprocal tutoring roles in the strategic activities. In each session, the higher performing student reads first for each activity to model desired performance. Both students in a pair read from material appropriate for the lower reader. As observed by Damon and Phelps (Damon, W., and Phelps, E., 1988), in the peer teaching, irrespective of the professional knowledge, teaching ability, or authority, there's little gap between the helper and the helped. It is the little gap that has a significant impact on the dialogues occurred during the interaction. The tutor, who is not as an expert or a teacher, doesn't teach like the teachers or put the tutee in a place of passive position. Hence, the reciprocal tutoring roles dare to ask questions and have the courage to try to solve the problems. They both learn by teaching and complete the construction of knowledge."

Vygotsky (1978) argued that one cannot fully understand children's developmental level without examining that development's upper boundary, which is determined by the kind of tasks that that children can do with assistance of someone else. The ZPD is a dialectical unity of learning-and-development, or more appropriately, learning-leading-development (Newman&amp; Holzman, 1993). In this unity, all kinds of higher mental activities, including thinking, planning, voluntary memory, voluntary attention, creativity and control of semiotic systems (especially language), will arise in the interaction between children and other members. So, the concept of ZPD highly underpins the necessity of interaction and collaboration with more skilled mediators."

As long as LAD receives and comprehends input containing linguistic features at i+1, the learner can acquire the language successfully, whether the person participates in linguistic interaction with others does not matter. Hence, according to Krashen, interaction is more or less irrelevant to language acquisition. However, Krashen acknowledges that two-way interaction in which meaning is negotiated through clarification requests and confirmation checks can help promote the acquisition process of language (Krashen, 1985). In this way, language is used as a way of communication in the acquisition process. The message is transmitted as output from one place and received as input elsewhere. When language users have difficulty in understanding each other, they will convey their meanings in a more comprehensible way by repeating a message verbatim, adjusting its syntax, changing its words, or modifying its form and meaning, and so on. Thus, the activity of negotiation during which language users receive comprehensible input and produce comprehensible output contributes to second language learning."

Teaching materials were applied from the reading part of Go for it students' book for Junior Three published by People's Education Press, which is also students' core course. Since each unit in Go for it for Junior Three consists of Section A, Section B and Reading, there're at least three to four passages for students to read each week. So the researcher applied PALS when it was time to give students reading teaching. Because of limited class time for Junior Three students and their graduation, PALS programs were implemented 2 times a week for nearly one school year; and each session lasted 45 minutes. During the process the researcher visited the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center at http: //kc. vanderbilt. edu/pals/ consequently to adjust some strategies. Also the researcher took pluralistic evaluation on the students' performance during using PALS (Appendix 1). Reading scores in the monthly test before treatment and in the model entrance exams after treatment were collected and analyzed. The researcher often made some interview among the students to know their attitudes"

The materials are chosen from PEP Primary English Book for Grade Six which is published by People's Education Press. The materials and tests are required by the new English curriculum criterion for the students entering the experiment. The data gained from the four classes includes pre-test and final-test. Because of the prior successful research in Junior Three students, the researcher assumes that PALS will help students of all levels make progress in English. PALS was applied for all the four classes and there is no control group. What the researcher wants to do is to compare the students' reading comprehension performance and their changes in English in the both tests and discuss the effect of PALS on pupils of Grade Six."

Wu1, the highest-performing student of the top half was paired with Liu2, the highest-performing student of the bottom half. Then following the rule, Liu1 was paired with Zheng4, till the pairing is done. There is one thing special. Chen is left single as there are 35 students in total in Class Three, so Chen is assigned with a pair who sit nearby him according to his willing.

In fact, the pupils, even the low-achieving ones, would be very active to be tutor first on condition that they had previewed the texts.

Some key words and expressions for the peers to start and continue their dialogue were listed for each learning part.

The questionnaire includes issues related to students' enjoyment and their perceived social and academic benefits of participation in PALS. In order to make it clear and understandable for the sixth grade students, the researcher put all the questions into Chinese and made some adjustment. Immediately after the experiment, pupils were required to mark the most suitable answer from five choices (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=kind of, 4= a lot, 5=a whole lot). What's more, one open-ended question was added to elicit more about participants' attitudes toward PALS in Primary English class and suggestions for improving PALS."

The total number of the pupils who took part in the test is 145, with one pupil's score missing because of learning disability, and the researcher will analyze his performance separately (see Section 4.1.3). The total marks for reading is 25. The segmentation is determined according to the standard of the evaluation for primary pupils used by Shangcheng Teaching Evaluation Department. In total, 87 pupils, over half of the grade, were low achieving in reading with the scores 0-14 out of 25. 54 pupils were average achieving with the sores from 15 to 21 and only 3 pupils (6.67%) were high achieving out of 144 students in the whole grade. It suggested that the pupils of the whole grade were very poor in English reading. In every class, more than half of the pupils were low achieving in reading. Things were worst in Class 4, with"

Though most students from migrant workers' families work hard, it is a fact that they do poor in English learning, partly because of their different accent and partly because of their backward foundation in English, since most of them didn't learn English before they came to Hangzhou. And compared with other native students in Hangzhou, they didn't spent much time in learning English, either. In some pilot research, the researcher once made some interview on students' English learning after school. The gathered information shows in the researcher's school, most students can't offer the money to learn English in some language schools like most native ones in other schools do. Some students need to help their family deal with business. And some even need to be babysitter after school to take care of their younger sisters or brothers. Thus, there's always great gap in learning quality between the researcher's school and the whole district. However, Table 4.7 showed that the gap, irrespective of that between mean score, excellent rate or pass rate, was comprehensively shortened after a semester's experiment with the mean score gap changing from -11.13 to -7.02, the excellent rate changing from -27.88 to -18.39, and the pass rate changing from -18.00 to -5.95. Among them, the pass rate increased fastest."

Firstly, students were really weak in reading aloud, knowing little of phonetic principles because they were paid little attention in most traditional classes, though there is much practice on it in PEP English books. In peer activities, students got more chances to practice reading in class. Secondly, timely feedback from the teacher or a tutor contributed to the improvement.

Take the author‘s school as an example, there‘s only one professional English teacher for all  the pupils in 16 classes from Grade 3 to Grade 6 before the author go to do the connective English teaching between elementary schools and junior high schools. During the first year‘s connective English teaching between elementary schools and junior high schools, the author found pupils were totally poor in English. The biggest problem is that most of them can‘t recognize or read what they had learnt in their PEP English textbooks. Thus it was really difficult for them to read the simple stories or short passages appeared in each unit in the PEP English textbook of Grade Six. And it seemed  difficult  for  them  to  answer  simple  questions  like  ―Yes‖  or  ―No‖  questions because they couldn‘t catch what they read."

In the 1960s, peer education programs were implemented in many U. S. schools.

PALS is a version of class wide peer tutoring. Teachers identify which children require help on specific skills and who the most appropriate children are to help other children learn those skills. Using this information, teachers pair students in the class, so that partners work simultaneously and productively on different activities that address the problems they are experiencing. Pairs are changed regularly, and over a period of time as students work on a variety of skills, all students have  the  opportunity to  be ―coaches‖ and ―players‖. Many structured  reading activities such as Reading aloud with Retelling, Paragraph Shrinking and Prediction Relay are carefully designed to improve students' reading skills to (a) cumulatively review information read, (b) sequence information, (c) summarize paragraphs and pages, (d) state main ideas in as few words as possible, and (e) predict and check outcomes (Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995). Since 1980s, PALS programs have been conducted worldwide and extended from kindergarten to high school. A large number of evidence suggests that interacting in this type of classwide peer tutoring improves students' achievement (e. g. Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995; Mastropieri, et al., 2001; McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006; Topping, 2005). Findings of PALS research include more academic time on tasks, academic and social growth, friendship among students, positive affective attitudes toward learning, and  feasibility for implementation. Hence, PALS  was  awarded ―Best Practice‖status from the U. S Department of Education Program Effectiveness Panel (McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006)."

PT is an approach based on peer mediated instruction, whereby children take turns to be tutors or tutees and work together to support each other's learning. An advantage of peer mediation is that subgroups of children in the same classroom can operate on different levels of curricula and use different instructional procedures. Teachers, in effect, can oversee many lessons simultaneously and address a broader range of students' educational needs, including those of many English-language learners and students with disabilities. Research in the elementary grades shows that children's reading competence improves when they work with each other in a cooperative and structured manner (e. g., Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989; Rosenshine &amp; Meister, 1994; Stevens, Madden, Slavin, &amp; Famish, 1987). It is clear that PT has striking advantages compared with CL. Firstly, students learn together in the smallest group of two members in the way of PT. Dyads of students can communicate and understand each other well and soon get accustomed to the learning procedures. Secondly, each student benefits from preparing to teach another student for PT is reciprocal, enabling each student to assume both roles of tutor and tutee. Study evidence shows that classroom-based reciprocal tutoring can effectively increase students' academic productivity and course self-satisfaction (Wolfe, Fantuzzo, &amp; Wolfe, 1986). Research on PT illustrates its efficacy in learning because it (a) increases students' academic and social development, (b) promotes students' positive intrinsic motivation and enhances cognitive skills within participating and reciprocal peers, (c) improves tutors' interpersonal and communicative skills, and (d) increases students' task"

They listen to the teacher, follow the tape, answer some questions together and complete assignments, focusing on their own interest and ignoring the success or failure of others. According to Johnson &amp; Johnson (1994), in peer interactions, pupils can acquire attitudes, values, skills and information which are unobtainable from adults. Peer interaction prepares pupils for models of social behavior and peer relationships help kill loneliness and build up a sense of belonging among community.

Later Bell found that this is a very important teaching method. To further promote the burgeoning development of this new teaching method, his school made significant adjustments. According to students' academic placement, they put higher students in a higher-level class and lower students in a lower-level class. Bell also made half students of each class teachers (tutors) and the other half students (tutees) to accept the help of tutors. Meanwhile, teachers and teaching assistants inspected here and there to help children, to monitor children and to evaluate those tutors and tutees to ensure the effectiveness of this teaching system."

Youth Teaching Youth was one of the earliest and best-known peer tutoring programs of this area. It was an afterschool program implemented in Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey (Gerber &amp; Kauffman, 1981). Since then, many forms of peer tutoring programs have been implemented in many U. S. schools and universities. These researches differ in whether the tutor is of similar age as the tutee and whether the tutor's and tutee's responsibilities are reciprocal. The programs have differed, too, in term of structure (high vs. low), setting (classroom vs. special education), intensity (e. g., one 15-min. sessiom per week vs. five45-min. sessions per week), time of day (during school vs. after school), targeted domain (personal/social vs. academic), scope (e. g., supplementing the curriculum vs. supplanting the curriculum), and so forth (Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, &amp; Simmon, 1997). Several meta-analyses of peer tutoring studies indicate that peer tutoring can contribute to students' school achievement (e. g., Cohen,"

In addition, the PALS programs are practical and are enjoyed by teachers and students. PALS has several crucial features. First, with PALS, every student in the class is paired. In each pair, one student is academically stronger than the other. During each PALS session, the students in a pair take turns as tutor and tutee while working on structured activities that address the difficulties each may be experiencing. This pairing creates 10 to 15 instructional experiences in a given classroom, each geared to individual needs. Second, it also permits the teacher to circulate in the class, to observe students, and to provide individual help as needed. Third, activities focus on key skills in reading and target the development of fluency and reading comprehension and reflect state-of-the-art instructional practices. Fourth, here is a structured reinforcement system in PALS. Elementary school pupils are assigned to a team and earn points. The winning team wins the class' applause and the teacher's praise. For high-school students, PALS offers tangible reinforces such as CDs, local sports-team apparel, and fast-food coupons (Gu Hongyan, 2010). So PALS motivates students to do better in reading and is found to be enjoyable by teachers and students. Finally, PALS does not provide any reading material for students in grades 2-6 or high school because it is a kind of curriculum-based reading program. It is the teacher's responsibility to select appropriate reading materials. For example, teachers have used PLAS-Reading as effectively with whole language instruction as with phonics-based approaches. PALS enhances teachers' ongoing practices (PALS Brochure, 2011). So it has feasibility and is meaningful in China."

Another important representative Vygotsky (1978), also pointed out that learning is ―social construction‖. The role of cultural and historical background influences the cognitive development of learners. Activities and social interaction both play an important role in the development of high-level mental."

It is through the mediation of others that the child undertakes activities (Vygotsky, 1978). Williams&amp; Burden (2000) defined mediation as the part played by significant others in the learners' lives, who enhance their learning by selecting and shaping the learning experiences presented to them. PALS makes good use of this theory and successfully make the tutor and tutee be the significant others for each other by creating reciprocal tutoring roles in the strategic activities. In each session, the higher performing student reads first for each activity to model desired performance. Both students in a pair read from material appropriate for the lower reader. As observed by Damon and Phelps (Damon, W., and Phelps, E., 1988), in the peer teaching, irrespective of the professional knowledge, teaching ability, or authority, there's little gap between the helper and the helped. It is the little gap that has a significant impact on the dialogues occurred during the interaction. The tutor, who is not as an expert or a teacher, doesn't teach like the teachers or put the tutee in a place of passive position. Hence, the reciprocal tutoring roles dare to ask questions and have the courage to try to solve the problems. They both learn by teaching and complete the construction of knowledge."

Vygotsky (1978) argued that one cannot fully understand children's developmental level without examining that development's upper boundary, which is determined by the kind of tasks that that children can do with assistance of someone else. The ZPD is a dialectical unity of learning-and-development, or more appropriately, learning-leading-development (Newman&amp; Holzman, 1993). In this unity, all kinds of higher mental activities, including thinking, planning, voluntary memory, voluntary attention, creativity and control of semiotic systems (especially language), will arise in the interaction between children and other members. So, the concept of ZPD highly underpins the necessity of interaction and collaboration with more skilled mediators."

Hence, according to Krashen, interaction is more or less irrelevant to language acquisition. However, Krashen acknowledges that two-way interaction in which meaning is negotiated through clarification requests and confirmation checks can help promote the acquisition process of language (Krashen, 1985). In this way, language is used as a way of communication in the acquisition process. The message is transmitted as output from one place and received as input elsewhere. When language users have difficulty in understanding each other, they will convey their meanings in a more comprehensible way by repeating a message verbatim, adjusting its syntax, changing its words, or modifying its form and meaning, and so on. Thus, the activity of negotiation during which language users receive comprehensible input and produce comprehensible output contributes to second language learning."

The participants were 72 students of Junior Three in the 2008 school year. Students were paired to 18 dyads in each class according to their scores of English test given by Shangcheng Evaluation Department and then the pairs were regularly changed according to scores of monthly test. Teaching materials were applied from the reading part of Go for it students' book for Junior Three published by People's Education Press, which is also students' core course. Since each unit in Go for it for Junior Three consists of Section A, Section B and Reading, there're at least three to four passages for students to read each week. So the researcher applied PALS when it was time to give students reading teaching. Because of limited class time for Junior Three students and their graduation, PALS programs were implemented 2 times a week for nearly one school year; and each session lasted 45 minutes. During the process the researcher visited the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center at http: //kc. vanderbilt. edu/pals/ consequently to adjust some strategies. Also the researcher took pluralistic evaluation on the students' performance during using PALS (Appendix 1). Reading scores in the monthly test before treatment and in the model entrance exams after treatment were collected and analyzed. The researcher often made some interview among the students to know their attitudes"

In fact, these students had been taught English by different teachers before because of the lack of professional teachers mentioned in the research background. They have been learning English for one to three years, coming from different places nationwide. The materials are chosen from PEP Primary English Book for Grade Six which is published by People's Education Press. The materials and tests are required by the new English curriculum criterion for the students entering the experiment. The data gained from the four classes includes pre-test and final-test. Because of the prior successful research in Junior Three students, the researcher assumes that PALS will help students of all levels make progress in English. PALS was applied for all the four classes and there is no control group. What the researcher wants to do is to compare the students' reading comprehension performance and their changes in English in the both tests and discuss the effect of PALS on pupils of Grade Six."

Still take Class Three as a sample and this can be seen clearly in the following table (see Table 3.2). Wu1, the highest-performing student of the top half was paired with Liu2, the highest-performing student of the bottom half. Then following the rule, Liu1 was paired with Zheng4, till the pairing is done. There is one thing special.

In this special group, they take turns to finish each PALS activity. The researcher deals with the same situation in the same way in Class One and Class Four, each of which has 37 students."

In fact, the pupils, even the low-achieving ones, would be very active to be tutor first on condition that they had previewed the texts.

The questionnaire includes issues related to students' enjoyment and their perceived social and academic benefits of participation in PALS. In order to make it clear and understandable for the sixth grade students, the researcher put all the questions into Chinese and made some adjustment. Immediately after the experiment, pupils were required to mark the most suitable answer from five choices (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=kind of, 4= a lot, 5=a whole lot). What's more, one open-ended question was added to elicit more about participants' attitudes toward PALS in Primary English class and suggestions for improving PALS."

The total number of the pupils who took part in the test is 145, with one pupil's score missing because of learning disability, and the researcher will analyze his performance separately (see Section 4.1.3). The total marks for reading is 25. The segmentation is determined according to the standard of the evaluation for primary pupils used by Shangcheng Teaching Evaluation Department. In total, 87 pupils, over half of the grade, were low achieving in reading with the scores 0-14 out of 25. 54 pupils were average achieving with the sores from 15 to 21 and only 3 pupils (6.67%) were high achieving out of 144 students in the whole grade.

Though most students from migrant workers' families work hard, it is a fact that they do poor in English learning, partly because of their different accent and partly because of their backward foundation in English, since most of them didn't learn English before they came to Hangzhou. And compared with other native students in Hangzhou, they didn't spent much time in learning English, either. In some pilot research, the researcher once made some interview on students' English learning after school. The gathered information shows in the researcher's school, most students can't offer the money to learn English in some language schools like most native ones in other schools do. Some students need to help their family deal with business. And some even need to be babysitter after school to take care of their younger sisters or brothers. Thus, there's always great gap in learning quality between the researcher's school and the whole district. However, Table 4.7 showed that the gap, irrespective of that between mean score, excellent rate or pass rate, was comprehensively shortened after a semester's experiment with the mean score gap changing from -11.13 to -7.02, the excellent rate changing from -27.88 to -18.39, and the pass rate changing from -18.00 to -5.95. Among them, the pass rate increased fastest."

That's unlike some previous studies (e. g Simmons D. et al, l995, Fuchs, D., et al, 1997): PALS strong effects for students with learning disabilities in regular classrooms. One possible reason for that is, as the boy told the researcher later, he spent too much time on Chinese and only wanted to well in Chinese because the Chinese teacher was the head teacher of his class."

Firstly, students were really weak in reading aloud, knowing little of phonetic principles because they were paid little attention in most traditional classes, though there is much practice on it in PEP English books. In peer activities, students got more chances to practice reading in class. Secondly, timely feedback from the teacher or a tutor contributed to the improvement. Finally, as the improvement of reading aloud could be detected over a short period of time and points could easily be gained through reading, pupils thought this activity more meaningful."

Thus it was really difficult for them to read the simple stories or short passages appeared in each unit in the PEP English textbook of Grade Six. And it seemed  difficult  for  them  to  answer  simple  questions  like  ―Yes‖  or  ―No‖  questions because they couldn‘t catch what they read."

PALS is a version of class wide peer tutoring. Teachers identify which children require help on specific skills and who the most appropriate children are to help other children learn those skills. Using this information, teachers pair students in the class, so that partners work simultaneously and productively on different activities that address the problems they are experiencing. Pairs are changed regularly, and over a period of time as students work on a variety of skills, all students have  the  opportunity to  be ―coaches‖ and ―players‖. Many structured  reading activities such as Reading aloud with Retelling, Paragraph Shrinking and Prediction Relay are carefully designed to improve students' reading skills to (a) cumulatively review information read, (b) sequence information, (c) summarize paragraphs and pages, (d) state main ideas in as few words as possible, and (e) predict and check outcomes (Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995). Since 1980s, PALS programs have been conducted worldwide and extended from kindergarten to high school. A large number of evidence suggests that interacting in this type of classwide peer tutoring improves students' achievement (e. g. Fuchs, et al., 1997; Mathes, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 1995; Mastropieri, et al., 2001; McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006; Topping, 2005). Findings of PALS research include more academic time on tasks, academic and social growth, friendship among students, positive affective attitudes toward learning, and  feasibility for implementation. Hence, PALS  was  awarded ―Best Practice‖status from the U. S Department of Education Program Effectiveness Panel (McMaster, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2006)."

Since the time-limited English course and each teacher don't have the chance to teach the pupils English from the very beginning at Grade Three to Grade Six, it is difficult for the non-professional English teachers to teach the pupils in a systematic way. Meanwhile, the teachers are worried about finishing the teaching task, so they hesitate to spend time on varied activities which promote students' learning in English Class.

PT is an approach based on peer mediated instruction, whereby children take turns to be tutors or tutees and work together to support each other's learning. An advantage of peer mediation is that subgroups of children in the same classroom can operate on different levels of curricula and use different instructional procedures. Teachers, in effect, can oversee many lessons simultaneously and address a broader range of students' educational needs, including those of many English-language learners and students with disabilities. Research in the elementary grades shows that children's reading competence improves when they work with each other in a cooperative and structured manner (e. g., Greenwood, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989; Rosenshine &amp; Meister, 1994; Stevens, Madden, Slavin, &amp; Famish, 1987). It is clear that PT has striking advantages compared with CL. Firstly, students learn together in the smallest group of two members in the way of PT. Dyads of students can communicate and understand each other well and soon get accustomed to the learning procedures. Secondly, each student benefits from preparing to teach another student for PT is reciprocal, enabling each student to assume both roles of tutor and tutee. Study evidence shows that classroom-based reciprocal tutoring can effectively increase students' academic productivity and course self-satisfaction (Wolfe, Fantuzzo, &amp; Wolfe, 1986). Research on PT illustrates its efficacy in learning because it (a) increases students' academic and social development, (b) promotes students' positive intrinsic motivation and enhances cognitive skills within participating and reciprocal peers, (c) improves tutors' interpersonal and communicative skills, and (d) increases students' task"

In traditional classroom teaching, pupils are required to work individually most of the time. They listen to the teacher, follow the tape, answer some questions together and complete assignments, focusing on their own interest and ignoring the success or failure of others. According to Johnson &amp; Johnson (1994), in peer interactions, pupils can acquire attitudes, values, skills and information which are unobtainable from adults. Peer interaction prepares pupils for models of social behavior and peer relationships help kill loneliness and build up a sense of belonging among community. Peers benefit from the productivity and efficiency through their interdependence."

Later Bell found that this is a very important teaching method. To further promote the burgeoning development of this new teaching method, his school made significant adjustments. According to students' academic placement, they put higher students in a higher-level class and lower students in a lower-level class. Bell also made half students of each class teachers (tutors) and the other half students (tutees) to accept the help of tutors. Meanwhile, teachers and teaching assistants inspected here and there to help children, to monitor children and to evaluate those tutors and tutees to ensure the effectiveness of this teaching system."

S. schools and universities. These researches differ in whether the tutor is of similar age as the tutee and whether the tutor's and tutee's responsibilities are reciprocal. The programs have differed, too, in term of structure (high vs. low), setting (classroom vs. special education), intensity (e. g., one 15-min. sessiom per week vs. five45-min. sessions per week), time of day (during school vs. after school), targeted domain (personal/social vs. academic), scope (e. g., supplementing the curriculum vs. supplanting the curriculum), and so forth (Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, &amp; Simmon, 1997).

Saddler, B, Asaro, K., &amp; Behforooz, Bita, (2008) conducted a study on four young writers with learning disabilities. In this study sentence-combining practice with a peer-assistance component was used to improve the ability of four young students with LD to construct sentences and compose stories.

No studies of PALS have been found  to investigate its effects on students in a foreign context. In China, research on PALS has been limited to theoretical introduction and discussion. Seldom have the researchers tried PALS procedures in regular classrooms to examine its effectiveness in reading teaching. Therefore, the present study is aimed at bridging the research gap by examining PALS effects on reading performance in the China-specific primary school."

Additionally, there have been PALS evaluations conducted by educators in California, Iowa, and Texas independent of Vanderbilt researchers. These independent evaluations also find a strong―value-added‖for PALS Reading. Based on these findings, the U. S.

In addition, the PALS programs are practical and are enjoyed by teachers and students. PALS has several crucial features. First, with PALS, every student in the class is paired. In each pair, one student is academically stronger than the other. During each PALS session, the students in a pair take turns as tutor and tutee while working on structured activities that address the difficulties each may be experiencing. This pairing creates 10 to 15 instructional experiences in a given classroom, each geared to individual needs. Second, it also permits the teacher to circulate in the class, to observe students, and to provide individual help as needed. Third, activities focus on key skills in reading and target the development of fluency and reading comprehension and reflect state-of-the-art instructional practices. Fourth, here is a structured reinforcement system in PALS. Elementary school pupils are assigned to a team and earn points. The winning team wins the class' applause and the teacher's praise. For high-school students, PALS offers tangible reinforces such as CDs, local sports-team apparel, and fast-food coupons (Gu Hongyan, 2010). So PALS motivates students to do better in reading and is found to be enjoyable by teachers and students. Finally, PALS does not provide any reading material for students in grades 2-6 or high school because it is a kind of curriculum-based reading program. It is the teacher's responsibility to select appropriate reading materials. For example, teachers have used PLAS-Reading as effectively with whole language instruction as with phonics-based approaches. PALS enhances teachers' ongoing practices (PALS Brochure, 2011). So it has feasibility and is meaningful in China."

Another important representative Vygotsky (1978), also pointed out that learning is ―social construction‖. The role of cultural and historical background influences the cognitive development of learners. Activities and social interaction both play an important role in the development of high-level mental."

It is through the mediation of others that the child undertakes activities (Vygotsky, 1978). Williams&amp; Burden (2000) defined mediation as the part played by significant others in the learners' lives, who enhance their learning by selecting and shaping the learning experiences presented to them. PALS makes good use of this theory and successfully make the tutor and tutee be the significant others for each other by creating reciprocal tutoring roles in the strategic activities. In each session, the higher performing student reads first for each activity to model desired performance. Both students in a pair read from material appropriate for the lower reader. As observed by Damon and Phelps (Damon, W., and Phelps, E., 1988), in the peer teaching, irrespective of the professional knowledge, teaching ability, or authority, there's little gap between the helper and the helped. It is the little gap that has a significant impact on the dialogues occurred during the interaction. The tutor, who is not as an expert or a teacher, doesn't teach like the teachers or put the tutee in a place of passive position. Hence, the reciprocal tutoring roles dare to ask questions and have the courage to try to solve the problems. They both learn by teaching and complete the construction of knowledge."

Vygotsky (1978) argued that one cannot fully understand children's developmental level without examining that development's upper boundary, which is determined by the kind of tasks that that children can do with assistance of someone else. The ZPD is a dialectical unity of learning-and-development, or more appropriately, learning-leading-development (Newman&amp; Holzman, 1993). In this unity, all kinds of higher mental activities, including thinking, planning, voluntary memory, voluntary attention, creativity and control of semiotic systems (especially language), will arise in the interaction between children and other members. So, the concept of ZPD highly underpins the necessity of interaction and collaboration with more skilled mediators."

As long as LAD receives and comprehends input containing linguistic features at i+1, the learner can acquire the language successfully, whether the person participates in linguistic interaction with others does not matter. Hence, according to Krashen, interaction is more or less irrelevant to language acquisition. However, Krashen acknowledges that two-way interaction in which meaning is negotiated through clarification requests and confirmation checks can help promote the acquisition process of language (Krashen, 1985). In this way, language is used as a way of communication in the acquisition process. The message is transmitted as output from one place and received as input elsewhere. When language users have difficulty in understanding each other, they will convey their meanings in a more comprehensible way by repeating a message verbatim, adjusting its syntax, changing its words, or modifying its form and meaning, and so on. Thus, the activity of negotiation during which language users receive comprehensible input and produce comprehensible output contributes to second language learning."

Teaching materials were applied from the reading part of Go for it students' book for Junior Three published by People's Education Press, which is also students' core course. Since each unit in Go for it for Junior Three consists of Section A, Section B and Reading, there're at least three to four passages for students to read each week. So the researcher applied PALS when it was time to give students reading teaching. Because of limited class time for Junior Three students and their graduation, PALS programs were implemented 2 times a week for nearly one school year; and each session lasted 45 minutes. During the process the researcher visited the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center at http: //kc. vanderbilt. edu/pals/ consequently to adjust some strategies. Also the researcher took pluralistic evaluation on the students' performance during using PALS (Appendix 1). Reading scores in the monthly test before treatment and in the model entrance exams after treatment were collected and analyzed.

The materials are chosen from PEP Primary English Book for Grade Six which is published by People's Education Press. The materials and tests are required by the new English curriculum criterion for the students entering the experiment. The data gained from the four classes includes pre-test and final-test. Because of the prior successful research in Junior Three students, the researcher assumes that PALS will help students of all levels make progress in English. PALS was applied for all the four classes and there is no control group. What the researcher wants to do is to compare the students' reading comprehension performance and their changes in English in the both tests and discuss the effect of PALS on pupils of Grade Six."

Still take Class Three as a sample and this can be seen clearly in the following table (see Table 3.2). Wu1, the highest-performing student of the top half was paired with Liu2, the highest-performing student of the bottom half. Then following the rule, Liu1 was paired with Zheng4, till the pairing is done. There is one thing special. Chen is left single as there are 35 students in total in Class Three, so Chen is assigned with a pair who sit nearby him according to his willing.

Mini adjustments were accepted for reasonable reasons based on the researcher's observation and peers' self-evaluation. And so, the pairing lasted until the end of the experiment."

And the researcher always gave the dyad the freedom to decide who goes first in each section. In fact, the pupils, even the low-achieving ones, would be very active to be tutor first on condition that they had previewed the texts. Meanwhile the better ones who are also innocent and candid would be very helpful to give the chance to the lower to be tutors and then teach them.

During the reading aloud process, the pupils' roles are reciprocal because they take turns to be reader and tutor. The teacher guides the pupils to focus on the pronunciation of some difficult words such as country, always, drive, England, Australia, and however.

These questions include some easy common ones used for interaction such as―What did you learn first‖，―whatdidyoulearnnext‖，―Could you please tell me…‖, andso on.

The total number of the pupils who took part in the test is 145, with one pupil's score missing because of learning disability, and the researcher will analyze his performance separately (see Section 4.1.3). The total marks for reading is 25. The segmentation is determined according to the standard of the evaluation for primary pupils used by Shangcheng Teaching Evaluation Department. In total, 87 pupils, over half of the grade, were low achieving in reading with the scores 0-14 out of 25. 54 pupils were average achieving with the sores from 15 to 21 and only 3 pupils (6.67%) were high achieving out of 144 students in the whole grade.

Though most students from migrant workers' families work hard, it is a fact that they do poor in English learning, partly because of their different accent and partly because of their backward foundation in English, since most of them didn't learn English before they came to Hangzhou. And compared with other native students in Hangzhou, they didn't spent much time in learning English, either. In some pilot research, the researcher once made some interview on students' English learning after school. The gathered information shows in the researcher's school, most students can't offer the money to learn English in some language schools like most native ones in other schools do. Some students need to help their family deal with business. And some even need to be babysitter after school to take care of their younger sisters or brothers. Thus, there's always great gap in learning quality between the researcher's school and the whole district. However, Table 4.7 showed that the gap, irrespective of that between mean score, excellent rate or pass rate, was comprehensively shortened after a semester's experiment with the mean score gap changing from -11.13 to -7.02, the excellent rate changing from -27.88 to -18.39, and the pass rate changing from -18.00 to -5.95. Among them, the pass rate increased fastest."

Firstly, students were really weak in reading aloud, knowing little of phonetic principles because they were paid little attention in most traditional classes, though there is much practice on it in PEP English books. In peer activities, students got more chances to practice reading in class. Secondly, timely feedback from the teacher or a tutor contributed to the improvement. Finally, as the improvement of reading aloud could be detected over a short period of time and points could easily be gained through reading, pupils thought this activity more meaningful."
