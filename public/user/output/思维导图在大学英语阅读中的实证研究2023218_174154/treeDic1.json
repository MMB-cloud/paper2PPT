To some extent, a language learner's language input relies on his reading ability. Krashen (1988) pointed out directly that other language abilities are the results of meaningful reading and reading is the fountainhead of most vocabulary knowledge, writing styles, advanced grammar ability as well as spelling. In the process of reading, students can not only acquire information, accumulate vocabularies, grasp the sentence patterns and cultivate their writing ability, but also broaden their horizon and know about other countries' culture. As we all know, reading occupies a high proportion in many linguist tests abroad and in China. It can be proved in the College English Test Band 4 or 6 (CET 4/6). In the whole test, the reading comprehension part takes up 35%. Hence, reading plays an important role in college students' English learning."

First, teachers only see the reading texts as a carrier of some knowledge points and focus mainly on the explaining and training of language points in the teaching process and spend most of the time on the analysis of language points. On the one hand, it leads to students' reading level just staying in the surface meaning of reading materials and lacking of overall grasp to the reading materials. On the other hand, students just get some one-sidedness of knowledge, it can not be applied to the real life and is difficult for the representation and transferring of the knowledge. Second, due to the limited reading class time, many teachers do not focus on the development of students' reading skills. When doing reading comprehension, students tend to do well in the objective questions but they always make errors in the subjective questions which need deep understanding to the passage. Third, English reading course is filled with teacher-based analysis, students are not treated as the learning center and are passively received the new knowledge. This utilitarian teaching approach ignores learners' initiative, inhibits learners' English reading interest, ignores the nature of English reading teaching, and is not helpful to promote learners' reading ability."

While through using mind map in college English reading, these problems can be solved effectively. By drawing mind maps, teachers guide students to giving priority to the analysis of passages as a whole then combine with the explaining of language points. The mind map of a reading passage can not only help students grasp the main ideas and know the detailed information and facts, but also can help students quickly understand the logical relationship well and students can make judgments and do some inferences based on their understanding. Besides, due to mind map stressing students' understanding to the passage as a whole, students can grasp well the writing purposes, the author's opinions, attitudes and writing features. In the process of drawing mind maps, students have a better understanding to the passage and at the same time it achieves students' language from input to output which indirectly improves reading efficiency. Therefore, the author hopes to apply mind map to the college English reading to achieve a good reading teaching and learning effect."

It creates effective conditions for tacit knowledge which can not directly effect on human's sensory, it shows knowledge in a means of graphic form which is explicit knowledge and can directly act on human's senses.

Knowledge in the form of graphically represented, provide a good complement and supplement to language-based understanding, which greatly reduces the cognitive load of language channel, and accelerates the generation of thinking."

Especially in Taiwan, many researchers use mind map to make innovative education experiments and conduct mind map workshops and publish mind map monographs. In mainland of China, the research of mind map in teaching subjects emerges increasingly in recent years. From the book\" Learning Revolution\" published in 1997, domestic scholars have started to study mind map. Until 2005, Mr. Buzan visited China and organized a series of training activities, mind map was really introduced into China. The research of mind map has also been included in Chinese Fifteenth Plan. At present, except for a small number of secondary schools has been introduced mind map to teaching, using mind map in a large scale in teaching and learning is still in the exploratory stage (Wei, 2010)."

Zhou (2013) studies the effectiveness of mind map in rural junior high school English reading course. Zhang (2005) did a case study on the application of min map in junior English reading. Wang (2014) explores the effect of mind map on adults' English reading. Cen (2011) confirms that mind map has a positive effect in the promotion of college students' reading competence."

Although the students were trained before the experiment, they were not very good at drawing mind maps. At first, students drew mind maps under the teacher's guidance and then they were required to make mind maps by themselves gradually. The detailed implementation procedures will be shown in Chapter 3.4.4."

For this reason, the difficulty of post-test was improved according to their current condition. The motivation of post-questionnaire is to investigate students' response after using mind map in English reading class. Compared with the pre-questionnaire, a question about students' cognition to mind map is added to post-questionnaire."

But as these are the basic requirements for students and nearly all students should get to this level. So some low-achievers still need to improve their ability in these aspects. For the Item 9, 10 and 11, the mean scores are all lower than 3, the results say that students do not do well in these aspects. That is to say, there are a lot of students who have difficulties in appreciating the author's viewpoints, writing intentions and attitudes, as well as organizing and generalizing the content of passages. These aspects are the intermediate requirements for students. Only students get to this level, can they have a good command of the reading passages. However, we can see that most of the students can not reach this level. As for item 12 and 13, we can see that there is a few students who draw the charts and use reading strategies to help them understand the logic and structure of the passages. It is easy to find out that most of the students do not have proper learning methods while reading."

As a result, students seldom do English reading actively and even the preview of the reading lesson. There are few students who often communicate with the teacher and classmates on their learning, which violate the New Curriculum Standard that require to develop students' initiative fully and students are the learning center and teachers are their guiders and facilitators. So it is necessary to change this situation. On the subject of the situation of students' English reading comprehension, nearly a half of them could get the lower level. Therefore, it is easy to find that in the traditional teaching, students' comprehension to English reading passage is shallow and not comprehensive. Taking all these into consideration, it is time to take measures to change the present situation. To our happiness, from students' answers, we learn that no one in EC has ever used mind map and most of them are glad to accept a new teaching method in their learning."

Some hope the teacher would explain more grammar and vocabularies. If we take all students' learning condition into consideration, it is impossible. As we all know, students draw mind map on their own, so there is a little difficulty for the students whose English foundation is  not good. Besides, in the traditional teaching, students get used to listening teachers' explaining and seldom do it by themselves, so at the beginning of the new method, they would feel hard to finish the mind map by themselves. Apart from this, to some students, their foundation is not so good that they can not read the reading passage without the teacher's help. So they demand the teacher to teach more basic knowledge."

Most students begin to do reading actively and they interact with their teacher and peers in class much more than what"

For senior students, they can use the key words more to make a mind map, which conform to their thinking characteristics and also can save time. In class, students' individual differences should be respected, and teachers should encourage students to develop their brain and participate in making mind map actively.

To some extent, a language learner's language input relies on his reading ability. Krashen (1988) pointed out directly that other language abilities are the results of meaningful reading and reading is the fountainhead of most vocabulary knowledge, writing styles, advanced grammar ability as well as spelling. In the process of reading, students can not only acquire information, accumulate vocabularies, grasp the sentence patterns and cultivate their writing ability, but also broaden their horizon and know about other countries' culture. As we all know, reading occupies a high proportion in many linguist tests abroad and in China. It can be proved in the College English Test Band 4 or 6 (CET 4/6). In the whole test, the reading comprehension part takes up 35%. Hence, reading plays an important role in college students' English learning."

First, teachers only see the reading texts as a carrier of some knowledge points and focus mainly on the explaining and training of language points in the teaching process and spend most of the time on the analysis of language points. On the one hand, it leads to students' reading level just staying in the surface meaning of reading materials and lacking of overall grasp to the reading materials. On the other hand, students just get some one-sidedness of knowledge, it can not be applied to the real life and is difficult for the representation and transferring of the knowledge. Second, due to the limited reading class time, many teachers do not focus on the development of students' reading skills. When doing reading comprehension, students tend to do well in the objective questions but they always make errors in the subjective questions which need deep understanding to the passage. Third, English reading course is filled with teacher-based analysis, students are not treated as the learning center and are passively received the new knowledge. This utilitarian teaching approach ignores learners' initiative, inhibits learners' English reading interest, ignores the nature of English reading teaching, and is not helpful to promote learners' reading ability."

While through using mind map in college English reading, these problems can be solved effectively. By drawing mind maps, teachers guide students to giving priority to the analysis of passages as a whole then combine with the explaining of language points. The mind map of a reading passage can not only help students grasp the main ideas and know the detailed information and facts, but also can help students quickly understand the logical relationship well and students can make judgments and do some inferences based on their understanding. Besides, due to mind map stressing students' understanding to the passage as a whole, students can grasp well the writing purposes, the author's opinions, attitudes and writing features. In the process of drawing mind maps, students have a better understanding to the passage and at the same time it achieves students' language from input to output which indirectly improves reading efficiency. Therefore, the author hopes to apply mind map to the college English reading to achieve a good reading teaching and learning effect."

It creates effective conditions for tacit knowledge which can not directly effect on human's sensory, it shows knowledge in a means of graphic form which is explicit knowledge and can directly act on human's senses.

Knowledge in the form of graphically represented, provide a good complement and supplement to language-based understanding, which greatly reduces the cognitive load of language channel, and accelerates the generation of thinking."

Farrand (2002) proved mind map is beneficial to students' recall to the facts of written information. Howitt (2009) explored the application of mind map to children's education and"

Especially in Taiwan, many researchers use mind map to make innovative education experiments and conduct mind map workshops and publish mind map monographs. In mainland of China, the research of mind map in teaching subjects emerges increasingly in recent years. From the book\" Learning Revolution\" published in 1997, domestic scholars have started to study mind map. Until 2005, Mr. Buzan visited China and organized a series of training activities, mind map was really introduced into China. The research of mind map has also been included in Chinese Fifteenth Plan. At present, except for a small number of secondary schools has been introduced mind map to teaching, using mind map in a large scale in teaching and learning is still in the exploratory stage (Wei, 2010)."

The teacher introduced mind map to students, completing with what mind map is, its features and functions, mind map software and how to draw mind map by hand and so on. To begin with, the students were given a reading passage to read for a few minutes and find out the main idea. Then the teacher asked students to find out key sentences of the main idea. And afterwards, students found out key words and phrases for the key sentences. Next, the teacher drew mind map according to the key words and phrases of each part. At last, the teacher used the sample mind map to explain the definition, characteristics and functions of mind map. The motivation is that students could understand what mind map is, and how to draw it according to a text vividly."

But as these are the basic requirements for students and nearly all students should get to this level. So some low-achievers still need to improve their ability in these aspects. For the Item 9, 10 and 11, the mean scores are all lower than 3, the results say that students do not do well in these aspects. That is to say, there are a lot of students who have difficulties in appreciating the author's viewpoints, writing intentions and attitudes, as well as organizing and generalizing the content of passages. These aspects are the intermediate requirements for students. Only students get to this level, can they have a good command of the reading passages. However, we can see that most of the students can not reach this level. As for item 12 and 13, we can see that there is a few students who draw the charts and use reading strategies to help them understand the logic and structure of the passages. It is easy to find out that most of the students do not have proper learning methods while reading."

As a result, students seldom do English reading actively and even the preview of the reading lesson. There are few students who often communicate with the teacher and classmates on their learning, which violate the New Curriculum Standard that require to develop students' initiative fully and students are the learning center and teachers are their guiders and facilitators. So it is necessary to change this situation. On the subject of the situation of students' English reading comprehension, nearly a half of them could get the lower level. Therefore, it is easy to find that in the traditional teaching, students' comprehension to English reading passage is shallow and not comprehensive. Taking all these into consideration, it is time to take measures to change the present situation. To our happiness, from students' answers, we learn that no one in EC has ever used mind map and most of them are glad to accept a new teaching method in their learning."

Some hope the teacher would explain more grammar and vocabularies. If we take all students' learning condition into consideration, it is impossible. As we all know, students draw mind map on their own, so there is a little difficulty for the students whose English foundation is  not good. Besides, in the traditional teaching, students get used to listening teachers' explaining and seldom do it by themselves, so at the beginning of the new method, they would feel hard to finish the mind map by themselves. Apart from this, to some students, their foundation is not so good that they can not read the reading passage without the teacher's help. So they demand the teacher to teach more basic knowledge."

From the data of post-test, it is evident that the reading score of EC is higher than that of CC. Mind map presents the knowledge by a structure of graphics, key words, branches and colors. It turns boring information into a colorful, easy to remember, highly organized diagram, which is in line with the working principle of the human brain. With mind map, students can build the original monochrome plane information into colorful, three-dimensional graphics, which contributes to better understanding the deep content and structure of reading material."

Once a mind map finishes, the logic relationship of the context is so clear that students can do some judgments and inference according to it. Then adding to the teacher's explaining to the important and difficult knowledge points, under the guidance of teacher, students can have a good command of the author's viewpoints, writing intention, attitudes and writing features instead of focusing on the translation of long sentences.

To some extent, a language learner's language input relies on his reading ability. Krashen (1988) pointed out directly that other language abilities are the results of meaningful reading and reading is the fountainhead of most vocabulary knowledge, writing styles, advanced grammar ability as well as spelling. In the process of reading, students can not only acquire information, accumulate vocabularies, grasp the sentence patterns and cultivate their writing ability, but also broaden their horizon and know about other countries' culture. As we all know, reading occupies a high proportion in many linguist tests abroad and in China. It can be proved in the College English Test Band 4 or 6 (CET 4/6). In the whole test, the reading comprehension part takes up 35%. Hence, reading plays an important role in college students' English learning."

First, teachers only see the reading texts as a carrier of some knowledge points and focus mainly on the explaining and training of language points in the teaching process and spend most of the time on the analysis of language points. On the one hand, it leads to students' reading level just staying in the surface meaning of reading materials and lacking of overall grasp to the reading materials. On the other hand, students just get some one-sidedness of knowledge, it can not be applied to the real life and is difficult for the representation and transferring of the knowledge. Second, due to the limited reading class time, many teachers do not focus on the development of students' reading skills. When doing reading comprehension, students tend to do well in the objective questions but they always make errors in the subjective questions which need deep understanding to the passage. Third, English reading course is filled with teacher-based analysis, students are not treated as the learning center and are passively received the new knowledge. This utilitarian teaching approach ignores learners' initiative, inhibits learners' English reading interest, ignores the nature of English reading teaching, and is not helpful to promote learners' reading ability."

By drawing mind maps, teachers guide students to giving priority to the analysis of passages as a whole then combine with the explaining of language points. The mind map of a reading passage can not only help students grasp the main ideas and know the detailed information and facts, but also can help students quickly understand the logical relationship well and students can make judgments and do some inferences based on their understanding. Besides, due to mind map stressing students' understanding to the passage as a whole, students can grasp well the writing purposes, the author's opinions, attitudes and writing features. In the process of drawing mind maps, students have a better understanding to the passage and at the same time it achieves students' language from input to output which indirectly improves reading efficiency. Therefore, the author hopes to apply mind map to the college English reading to achieve a good reading teaching and learning effect."

Now mind map can be used for almost all kinds of activities related to thinking, memory, making plans or creating such as essay writing, exams, meeting records, exchanges, lectures, study, work plans and data compilation. It affects 250 million people around the world to help them improve comprehension ability and memory, known as global revolutionary thinking tool, learning tool and management tool of the 21st century."

It creates effective conditions for tacit knowledge which can not directly effect on human's sensory, it shows knowledge in a means of graphic form which is explicit knowledge and can directly act on human's senses.

Knowledge in the form of graphically represented, provide a good complement and supplement to language-based understanding, which greatly reduces the cognitive load of language channel, and accelerates the generation of thinking."

In mainland of China, the research of mind map in teaching subjects emerges increasingly in recent years. From the book\" Learning Revolution\" published in 1997, domestic scholars have started to study mind map. Until 2005, Mr. Buzan visited China and organized a series of training activities, mind map was really introduced into China. The research of mind map has also been included in Chinese Fifteenth Plan. At present, except for a small number of secondary schools has been introduced mind map to teaching, using mind map in a large scale in teaching and learning is still in the exploratory stage (Wei, 2010)."

And afterwards, students found out key words and phrases for the key sentences. Next, the teacher drew mind map according to the key words and phrases of each part. At last, the teacher used the sample mind map to explain the definition, characteristics and functions of mind map. The motivation is that students could understand what mind map is, and how to draw it according to a text vividly."

But as these are the basic requirements for students and nearly all students should get to this level. So some low-achievers still need to improve their ability in these aspects. For the Item 9, 10 and 11, the mean scores are all lower than 3, the results say that students do not do well in these aspects. That is to say, there are a lot of students who have difficulties in appreciating the author's viewpoints, writing intentions and attitudes, as well as organizing and generalizing the content of passages. These aspects are the intermediate requirements for students. Only students get to this level, can they have a good command of the reading passages. However, we can see that most of the students can not reach this level. As for item 12 and 13, we can see that there is a few students who draw the charts and use reading strategies to help them understand the logic and structure of the passages. It is easy to find out that most of the students do not have proper learning methods while reading."

As is known, interest is one's best teacher. Hence, it is imperative to arouse students' interest in English reading class. Only this can they like and learn English reading. As a result, students seldom do English reading actively and even the preview of the reading lesson. There are few students who often communicate with the teacher and classmates on their learning, which violate the New Curriculum Standard that require to develop students' initiative fully and students are the learning center and teachers are their guiders and facilitators. So it is necessary to change this situation. On the subject of the situation of students' English reading comprehension, nearly a half of them could get the lower level. Therefore, it is easy to find that in the traditional teaching, students' comprehension to English reading passage is shallow and not comprehensive. Taking all these into consideration, it is time to take measures to change the present situation. To our happiness, from students' answers, we learn that no one in EC has ever used mind map and most of them are glad to accept a new teaching method in their learning."

Some hope the teacher would explain more grammar and vocabularies. If we take all students' learning condition into consideration, it is impossible. As we all know, students draw mind map on their own, so there is a little difficulty for the students whose English foundation is  not good. Besides, in the traditional teaching, students get used to listening teachers' explaining and seldom do it by themselves, so at the beginning of the new method, they would feel hard to finish the mind map by themselves. Apart from this, to some students, their foundation is not so good that they can not read the reading passage without the teacher's help. So they demand the teacher to teach more basic knowledge."

From the data of post-test, it is evident that the reading score of EC is higher than that of CC. Mind map presents the knowledge by a structure of graphics, key words, branches and colors. It turns boring information into a colorful, easy to remember, highly organized diagram, which is in line with the working principle of the human brain. With mind map, students can build the original monochrome plane information into colorful, three-dimensional graphics, which contributes to better understanding the deep content and structure of reading material."

Once a mind map finishes, the logic relationship of the context is so clear that students can do some judgments and inference according to it. Then adding to the teacher's explaining to the important and difficult knowledge points, under the guidance of teacher, students can have a good command of the author's viewpoints, writing intention, attitudes and writing features instead of focusing on the translation of long sentences.

To some extent, a language learner's language input relies on his reading ability. Krashen (1988) pointed out directly that other language abilities are the results of meaningful reading and reading is the fountainhead of most vocabulary knowledge, writing styles, advanced grammar ability as well as spelling. In the process of reading, students can not only acquire information, accumulate vocabularies, grasp the sentence patterns and cultivate their writing ability, but also broaden their horizon and know about other countries' culture. As we all know, reading occupies a high proportion in many linguist tests abroad and in China. It can be proved in the College English Test Band 4 or 6 (CET 4/6). In the whole test, the reading comprehension part takes up 35%. Hence, reading plays an important role in college students' English learning."

First, teachers only see the reading texts as a carrier of some knowledge points and focus mainly on the explaining and training of language points in the teaching process and spend most of the time on the analysis of language points. On the one hand, it leads to students' reading level just staying in the surface meaning of reading materials and lacking of overall grasp to the reading materials. On the other hand, students just get some one-sidedness of knowledge, it can not be applied to the real life and is difficult for the representation and transferring of the knowledge. Second, due to the limited reading class time, many teachers do not focus on the development of students' reading skills. When doing reading comprehension, students tend to do well in the objective questions but they always make errors in the subjective questions which need deep understanding to the passage. Third, English reading course is filled with teacher-based analysis, students are not treated as the learning center and are passively received the new knowledge. This utilitarian teaching approach ignores learners' initiative, inhibits learners' English reading interest, ignores the nature of English reading teaching, and is not helpful to promote learners' reading ability."

By drawing mind maps, teachers guide students to giving priority to the analysis of passages as a whole then combine with the explaining of language points. The mind map of a reading passage can not only help students grasp the main ideas and know the detailed information and facts, but also can help students quickly understand the logical relationship well and students can make judgments and do some inferences based on their understanding. Besides, due to mind map stressing students' understanding to the passage as a whole, students can grasp well the writing purposes, the author's opinions, attitudes and writing features. In the process of drawing mind maps, students have a better understanding to the passage and at the same time it achieves students' language from input to output which indirectly improves reading efficiency. Therefore, the author hopes to apply mind map to the college English reading to achieve a good reading teaching and learning effect."

Now mind map can be used for almost all kinds of activities related to thinking, memory, making plans or creating such as essay writing, exams, meeting records, exchanges, lectures, study, work plans and data compilation. It affects 250 million people around the world to help them improve comprehension ability and memory, known as global revolutionary thinking tool, learning tool and management tool of the 21st century."

It creates effective conditions for tacit knowledge which can not directly effect on human's sensory, it shows knowledge in a means of graphic form which is explicit knowledge and can directly act on human's senses.

Knowledge in the form of graphically represented, provide a good complement and supplement to language-based understanding, which greatly reduces the cognitive load of language channel, and accelerates the generation of thinking."

Until 1993, Tony Buzan has published more than twenty books, such as\" Mind Map - Radiant thinking\"，“The Power of Creative Intelligence\"，”How to Mind Map\" and so on, then they have been translated into many languages. As the official training institution of mind map, Buzan centers are around the world. Currently, mind map is widely used in the fields of culture, business and education."

In mainland of China, the research of mind map in teaching subjects emerges increasingly in recent years. From the book\" Learning Revolution\" published in 1997, domestic scholars have started to study mind map. Until 2005, Mr. Buzan visited China and organized a series of training activities, mind map was really introduced into China. The research of mind map has also been included in Chinese Fifteenth Plan. At present, except for a small number of secondary schools has been introduced mind map to teaching, using mind map in a large scale in teaching and learning is still in the exploratory stage (Wei, 2010)."

But as these are the basic requirements for students and nearly all students should get to this level. So some low-achievers still need to improve their ability in these aspects. For the Item 9, 10 and 11, the mean scores are all lower than 3, the results say that students do not do well in these aspects. That is to say, there are a lot of students who have difficulties in appreciating the author's viewpoints, writing intentions and attitudes, as well as organizing and generalizing the content of passages. These aspects are the intermediate requirements for students. Only students get to this level, can they have a good command of the reading passages. However, we can see that most of the students can not reach this level. As for item 12 and 13, we can see that there is a few students who draw the charts and use reading strategies to help them understand the logic and structure of the passages. It is easy to find out that most of the students do not have proper learning methods while reading."

As a result, students seldom do English reading actively and even the preview of the reading lesson. There are few students who often communicate with the teacher and classmates on their learning, which violate the New Curriculum Standard that require to develop students' initiative fully and students are the learning center and teachers are their guiders and facilitators. So it is necessary to change this situation. On the subject of the situation of students' English reading comprehension, nearly a half of them could get the lower level. Therefore, it is easy to find that in the traditional teaching, students' comprehension to English reading passage is shallow and not comprehensive. Taking all these into consideration, it is time to take measures to change the present situation. To our happiness, from students' answers, we learn that no one in EC has ever used mind map and most of them are glad to accept a new teaching method in their learning."

Some hope the teacher would explain more grammar and vocabularies. If we take all students' learning condition into consideration, it is impossible. As we all know, students draw mind map on their own, so there is a little difficulty for the students whose English foundation is  not good. Besides, in the traditional teaching, students get used to listening teachers' explaining and seldom do it by themselves, so at the beginning of the new method, they would feel hard to finish the mind map by themselves. Apart from this, to some students, their foundation is not so good that they can not read the reading passage without the teacher's help. So they demand the teacher to teach more basic knowledge."
