Since 2002, its consumer spending on the arts and culture products has remained in the $150 million range. Even in a slow economy during 2008 to 2009, the U. S. CCIs continued to grow steadily. In 2011, the value added from arts and cultural production accounted for almost 3.2%, or $504 billion of the U. S. GDP. Over two million workers were employed in the American cultural industries, accounting for 2.1% of all U. S. jobs. Up to 2013, the America's contribution of CCIs to its GDP has increased to 11.12%, devoting over one trillion dollars of value added to the national economy. It is concluded that the U. S.

The limitation of foreign studies is that they pay little attention on the CCIs of developing countries and qualitative studies are not well-presented. Correspondingly, Chinese scholars turn their attention on studying developed countries' CCIs in order to search relevant experience for China. These studies are often lack of quantitative studies. Hence, a systematic study on main countries' CCIs is necessary. The author aims to combine both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis in this thesis. With the support of previous theories and the application of statistical method, the comprehensive analysis of the U. S. CCIs is conducted in this thesis."

Then it covers literature reviews on CCIs, defines what is cultural economy and the sectors included in cultural industries. Then competitiveness theory is introduced as theory foundation for the quantitative analysis. The most important method that used in the quantitative study is factor analysis–principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a way of measuring and calculating observed variables, it evaluates the variables which are the most correlated and relevant to the research objectives. It is a simple but effective method in exploratory data for making predictive models. The factors that affect the American CCIs are demonstrated by the result scores. With the purpose to find out reasons leading to the success of the U. S. CCIs, 26 countries' competitiveness of their CCIs is compared and contrast. As a result, conclusions can be made by the comparison and analysis of 26 countries' CCIs."

Adorno's later works on film, radio, newspapers and music all reaffirmed the opinion that monopoly capitalism had become thoroughly absorbed by the economy (Huyssen, 1986; Adorno 1991). With the growth of capital economy, culture industry gradually involved into the economy and turned into a new individual industry. Adorno equates the American cultural industry with European Fascism ((Huyssen, 1986, p. 23) that the modern worker has been totally integrated into the industrial machine he now has his leisure time and his interiority controlled by modern industrial techniques. The Fordist factory system moved into the realm of culture used as a powerful ideological tool.

Although Adorno's idea about the cultural industries is negative, it still caused attention and became an important basis for future study. Later, scholars in Fordist school considered that the original capital collection were seen as the foundation for the development of cultural industries, most of the producers aimed to maximize their profits in order to satisfy customers' needs and wants. This view illustrates the positive side of the cultural industries and it has considered the market and consumers' needs for the first time, which is different from Adorno's idea. Granham (1987, p. 25) argued that this\" materialism\" tended to be both too much and not enough. To materialist in the sense that culture was seen to be completely reducible to the needs of\" capital\" or the\" ruling class\"; not materialist enough in the sense that, once stated, there was no examination of how this culture got produces, by whom and under what conditions. The central contention of the political economy school was that under capitalism culture was increasingly produced as a commodity, and thus subject to the logic and the contradictions of this system of production (O' Connor, 2010, p. 23)."

Cultural industries connect the inputs such as creativity and the outputs like aesthetic or intangible experience as a distinctive feature in the market. Galloway and Dunlop (2006, p.28) refer that any business or activity based on creativity can be considered as a creative industry. While, several famous authors (Higgs, Cunningham, &amp; Bakhshi, 2008) point out that measurable data and statistics work are more scientific in directing governments than theories and concepts. As the growing influence of internet and digital media, scholars start to focus on the significance of technologies on CCIs. Daniel Bell thinks that the information society has only limited influence, with most accounts of the creative industries being considerably more circumspect about proclaiming a postindustrial utopia for the creative workforce, and there has been considerable recognition of the question of precarious labor that often underpin contract employment and flexible working arrangements (Deuze, 2006; Cunningham, 2008). While other scholars like Hesmondhalgh, Miller and Kellner all hold positive view, they think the technologies should be maximized and combined with CCIs. Overall, foreign studies on CCIs have provided much reference for governments and organizations on developing their cultural industries."

Although China is a nation with long history and resourceful culture, Chinese CCIs have a shorter history of development and cannot compete with other western countries yet. In recent years, Chinese scholars have been trying to find out what is the most appropriate model for Chinese CCIs from many aspects, including from the view of strategy, international trade and business, clustering theory and regional development, policy-making, investment and financial model, cities' competitiveness, intellectual property right, and comparison between Chinese and Western culture.

Cultural economist David Throsby (Throsby, D. 2008, p. 229) has observed that the distinctions made between cultural and creative industries arise from a mix of inherent definitional difficulties in delineating\" culture\" and\" creativity\". Similarly, according to authors (Cunningham, 2002; Hesmondhalgh, 2002; Markusen, 2008), there is an distinction between cultural industries and creative industries, the creative economy has a broader sector of industries than cultural economy, including those purely cultural activities like science, engineering, computing and education which are excluded by cultural industries. Another major distinction mentioned by Galloway and Dunlop (2007) is the production of culture and meaning. Cultural economist David Throsby (2008) has noticed the distinction between cultural and creative industries come from the definitional difficulties in differentiating\" culture\" and\" creativity\" (Throsby 2008, p. 229). Definitions of cultural industry and creative industry are discussed below."

Jin Yuanpu (2010) furthers that CCIs are one of those industries that promote the development of the green industries and upgrade the transformation of Chinese traditional manufacturing industries. Moreover, with the involvement of highly-advanced technologies, CCIs even outperform other traditional industries with much stronger innovative advantage. Generally, Chinese scholars have put great emphasis on the importance of CCIs from the perspective of industrial reconstruction and transformation, and focused on the interrelationship among relevant industries."

The smallest circle in the model produces the copyrightable works of original value such as performing arts, literature, music, and visual arts. Outside the core creative arts, there are other core creative industries, which include film, museums, galleries, libraries and photography. In the third layer circle, the creative industries are expanded to sectors including advertising, architecture, design and fashion. The largest circle is the cultural related industries, composing of heritage services, publishing and print media, television and radio, sound recording, video and computer games. Overall, these circles are expanding from inside to outside according to their strength of creation and origination."

WEF defined competitiveness as\" the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country\" in the Global Competitiveness Report of 1997. In the same year of 1997, IMD defined competitiveness as a country's ability to create more wealth than its competitors in the international market. Both of these two institutes created evaluation indexes to measure a nation's competitiveness. These indexes are relevant to market openness, government management, financial situation, infrastructure, enterprises management, science and technology, and citizen quality. Each year, the global competitiveness reports released by these two institutions attract lots of attention, and their studies have become important reference for all the countries and governments."

With the consideration of these four major determinants and two environmental elements, a country or an area's specific industrial competitiveness can be measured and evaluated in current and future development. An industry's international competitiveness may then result from responding effectively to, and building on, the determining factors at any of the various geographic levels. Hence, it is the successful combination by a particular firm or industry of particular determinants at the relevant geographic levels, that leads to international competitiveness, not an exclusive or primary focus on national or local determinants."

These factors range from endowed factors such as infrastructure and landmass to economic factors such as foreign reserves. In accordance with Michael Porter's diamond of competitive advantage, the attributes of a nation have been sectioned into four main factors: condition factors; demand; related industries; strategy."

According to Porter, it is considered that the extent of factor conditions in a country or region would lead to business opportunity recognition in certain industries, which consequently triggers entrepreneurial mindset due to the speed of knowledge transfer and access to specific resources. In other words, the companies' behavior is guided in the market or industry by the availability of resources in the environment.

Porter also places emphasis on the role of home demand in providing impetus for industry's upgrading and innovation due to the fact that domestic firms are the most sensitive to the needs of its closest customers. With this regard, domestic firms can transfer the domestic demand into their international expansion so as to compete with international competitors. In light of the available market information, potential entrepreneurs' mindset is fashioned and adapted to the existing market demand and thereby more likely to explore new ideas related with that demand. By focusing on existing market demand knowledgeable entrepreneurs can introduce new products, services, sources of input or advances that lead to increased entrepreneurial behavior. In sum, individuals with information on certain market demands or industries may recognize more entrepreneurial opportunities in these industries and markets than those who have no knowledge and no market shares on these industries."

When industries coordinate activities and form clusters of supporting industries within the value chain they achieve a competitive advantage (Porter, 1991). It is believed that the strength and competitiveness of related and supporting industries in a region or country initiates the entrepreneurial mindset in recognizing and finding out market opportunities. When local supporting industries are competitive, new entrants continue to grow in both related and supportive industries and later form clusters. Due to the transfer of information flow and transactions between buyers and sellers, firms can better think up with the most cost-effective and innovative products. Industrial clusters or related and supporting industries are critical in technology transfer and innovation (Tan, 2006, p. 842), which also facilitate cooperation, efficiency and flexibility, lower transportation and traffic costs during the producing process (Porter, 1990). The power and strength of the related and supporting industries in a region or country improves both horizontal and vertical connections and interactions within industries (Walzer, Shumway, &amp; Gruidl, 2005), what's more, it stimulates social interaction, information communication and exchange (Saxenian, 1994; Jacobs &amp; De Man, 1996; Rosenfeld, 1996). Social infrastructure inside the value chain of the related and supporting industries helps the transfer of technology and knowledge (Rosenfeld, 1997). Therefore, it is suggested that the access to social infrastructure within the related industries will encourage new ideas and new business cooperation, which will invite experimentation, enhance potential critical thinking, and lead to more business opportunities."

A stream of research found that the external environment plays a crucial factor  in creating opportunities as opportunity recognition is a process influenced by many contextual factors in the external environment (Gaglio &amp; Taub, 1992; Singh, 1998), most importantly the availability of resources (Timmons, 1994) and assorted technologies (Zahra, 2008, p. 245). Based on this reasoning, environmental contexts and technology, consumer economics, social valued and governmental regulations (Stevensen &amp; Gumpert, 1985) and changing trends in the present. In other words, entrepreneurs identify opportunities by using various information about the environment (Busenitz &amp; Barney, 1997). They make a habit of scanning their environments for information that may lead to entrepreneurial opportunities (Stewart, May, &amp; Kalia, 2008). Thus, government can influence entrepreneurs and their competitive advantages through policies and laws implemented in the markets, such as setting the production standards, compensations, subsidies and competition regulations. Although opportunities and government factor are not determinants to the competitive advantages, these two factors can indirectly influence the entrepreneurial and industrial competiveness. To conclude, an industry's international competitiveness is still mainly determined by the four factors, factors conditions, demand conditions, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry, related and supporting industries, the Porter's diamond model of national competitive advantage can be interactive and dynamic."

At a regional competition level, innovation is a determinant of a region's international competitiveness. Economist Cooke holds the view that regional innovation system is made up with the manufacturing enterprises, research institutions and higher education institutions, which are separated and correlated geographically. Innovation is not only critically important for technological enterprises, but for any enterprise that wants to expand their business and maintains its sustainable international competitiveness. Hence, innovation is a new important determinant in improving international competitiveness for any country or region in the informational era, any industry that wants to maintain its sustainable competitiveness must offer financial support in escalating the level of research and development."

The increase was result to the rising box office of the U.S. box office, which is up 33% over five years ago. In the year of 2013, U.S. box office was $10.9 billion, up one percent from $10.8 billion in 2012, and up three percent from 2009. It is seen that the U.S. box office accounts for the largest global box office in the international movie industries, and the portion keeps growing year by year with stronger growing impetus. All this are result to the fact that the U.S. CCIs have been upgrading the industries by consistently innovating the technology and expanding the overseas markets. See Figure 4.2.7and Table 4.2.8."

It is usually used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. The Principal Components Analysis is conducted through eigenvalue decomposition of a data matrix. The results of the analysis are usually discussed in terms of component scores, which also named factor scores (the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point), and loadings (the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score). It is one of the oldest, simplest and useful statistical method to illustrate the interrelationship of the correlated variances and provide specific assumptions for research and studies."

The Kaiser-Meryer-Olkin statistic is a Measure of Sampling Adequacy, it shows the summary of how small the correlations are, relative to the original correlation (Kaiser, 1970). The overall KMO is printed in the\" KMO and Bartlett's Test\" table of the Factor Output. Generally, principal components analysis requires that the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy be greater than 0.50. KMO statistic Kaiser (1974) recommends a bare minimum of 0.5 and that values below 0.60 as unacceptable, between 0.60 and 0.70 are mediocre, values between 0.7 and 0.8 are good, values between 0.8 and 0.9 are great. For these data the value of this principal component analysis is 0.620, which is satisfied with the requirement and it is considered that the sample size is adequate for factor analysis. Besides, Bartlett's test of sphericity tests the hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identify matrix, which would indicate that the variables are unrelated and therefore unsuitable for structure detection. Small values (less than 0.01) of the significance level indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with the data. As shown in Table 5.2, the significance is 0.000, which is suitable for factor analysis."

The shortage of qualified labor talents largely impedes the growth of Chinese CCIs to go international. Therefore, long-term efforts must be taken into education and on-the-job training so as to increase our labor competitiveness; international exchange of talents or abroad training will also do help to the improvement of domestic labor quality. What's more, the higher level of education would definitely increase the demand of the cultural products and service, which would also stimulate the reform and innovation of education."

Since 2002, its consumer spending on the arts and culture products has remained in the $150 million range. Even in a slow economy during 2008 to 2009, the U. S. CCIs continued to grow steadily. In 2011, the value added from arts and cultural production accounted for almost 3.2%, or $504 billion of the U. S. GDP. Over two million workers were employed in the American cultural industries, accounting for 2.1% of all U. S. jobs. Up to 2013, the America's contribution of CCIs to its GDP has increased to 11.12%, devoting over one trillion dollars of value added to the national economy. It is concluded that the U. S.

On one hand, they are similar in defining and classifying the CCIs. Terms like\" creative industries\"，“cultural industries\"，”copyright industries\" are of little difference for them. On the other hand, both the foreign studies and domestic studies on CCIs share several major differences. In the first place, foreign scholars mainly focus on general definitions, classifications, and features of the CCIs. They center on the elaboration of copyright system and specific sectors, such as film industry and music industry, and use economic indicators or models to describe the CCIs. While Chinese scholars concentrate more on studying theories and cases, including the clustering theory of CCIs, the competitiveness theories, and comparative studies between developed countries and China, among which most of the studies are qualitative analysis. Secondly, foreign scholars attach much more emphasis on the industrial structure and economic value held in American CCIs. In contrast, Chinese scholars are inclined to study the history and developmental experience from previous studies on the"

The limitation of foreign studies is that they pay little attention on the CCIs of developing countries and qualitative studies are not well-presented. Correspondingly, Chinese scholars turn their attention on studying developed countries' CCIs in order to search relevant experience for China. These studies are often lack of quantitative studies. Hence, a systematic study on main countries' CCIs is necessary. The author aims to combine both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis in this thesis. With the support of previous theories and the application of statistical method, the comprehensive analysis of the U. S. CCIs is conducted in this thesis."

PCA is a way of measuring and calculating observed variables, it evaluates the variables which are the most correlated and relevant to the research objectives. It is a simple but effective method in exploratory data for making predictive models. The factors that affect the American CCIs are demonstrated by the result scores. With the purpose to find out reasons leading to the success of the U. S. CCIs, 26 countries' competitiveness of their CCIs is compared and contrast. As a result, conclusions can be made by the comparison and analysis of 26 countries' CCIs."

Adorno's later works on film, radio, newspapers and music all reaffirmed the opinion that monopoly capitalism had become thoroughly absorbed by the economy (Huyssen, 1986; Adorno 1991). With the growth of capital economy, culture industry gradually involved into the economy and turned into a new individual industry. Adorno equates the American cultural industry with European Fascism ((Huyssen, 1986, p. 23) that the modern worker has been totally integrated into the industrial machine he now has his leisure time and his interiority controlled by modern industrial techniques. The Fordist factory system moved into the realm of culture used as a powerful ideological tool.

Although Adorno's idea about the cultural industries is negative, it still caused attention and became an important basis for future study. Later, scholars in Fordist school considered that the original capital collection were seen as the foundation for the development of cultural industries, most of the producers aimed to maximize their profits in order to satisfy customers' needs and wants. This view illustrates the positive side of the cultural industries and it has considered the market and consumers' needs for the first time, which is different from Adorno's idea. Granham (1987, p. 25) argued that this\" materialism\" tended to be both too much and not enough. To materialist in the sense that culture was seen to be completely reducible to the needs of\" capital\" or the\" ruling class\"; not materialist enough in the sense that, once stated, there was no examination of how this culture got produces, by whom and under what conditions. The central contention of the political economy school was that under capitalism culture was increasingly produced as a commodity, and thus subject to the logic and the contradictions of this system of production (O' Connor, 2010, p. 23)."

Cultural industries connect the inputs such as creativity and the outputs like aesthetic or intangible experience as a distinctive feature in the market. Galloway and Dunlop (2006, p.28) refer that any business or activity based on creativity can be considered as a creative industry. While, several famous authors (Higgs, Cunningham, &amp; Bakhshi, 2008) point out that measurable data and statistics work are more scientific in directing governments than theories and concepts. As the growing influence of internet and digital media, scholars start to focus on the significance of technologies on CCIs. Daniel Bell thinks that the information society has only limited influence, with most accounts of the creative industries being considerably more circumspect about proclaiming a postindustrial utopia for the creative workforce, and there has been considerable recognition of the question of precarious labor that often underpin contract employment and flexible working arrangements (Deuze, 2006; Cunningham, 2008). While other scholars like Hesmondhalgh, Miller and Kellner all hold positive view, they think the technologies should be maximized and combined with CCIs. Overall, foreign studies on CCIs have provided much reference for governments and organizations on developing their cultural industries."

During 1970s, western authors involved in researching the cultural industry across different industries and regions and expanded their research from western to eastern areas. After 1980s, with the adoption of Marxism, Chinese academic scholars started researching on the Frankfurt theory on cultural economies and cultural industries, which has became the foundation of domestic research of cultural industries. Although China is a nation with long history and resourceful culture, Chinese CCIs have a shorter history of development and cannot compete with other western countries yet. In recent years, Chinese scholars have been trying to find out what is the most appropriate model for Chinese CCIs from many aspects, including from the view of strategy, international trade and business, clustering theory and regional development, policy-making, investment and financial model, cities' competitiveness, intellectual property right, and comparison between Chinese and Western culture. Today, the cultural industries have become one of the major economic talking points of China's social and economic development, and cultural consumption has started to become a feature that permeates all of people's lives on a daily basis.

Similarly, according to authors (Cunningham, 2002; Hesmondhalgh, 2002; Markusen, 2008), there is an distinction between cultural industries and creative industries, the creative economy has a broader sector of industries than cultural economy, including those purely cultural activities like science, engineering, computing and education which are excluded by cultural industries. Another major distinction mentioned by Galloway and Dunlop (2007) is the production of culture and meaning. Cultural economist David Throsby (2008) has noticed the distinction between cultural and creative industries come from the definitional difficulties in differentiating\" culture\" and\" creativity\" (Throsby 2008, p. 229). Definitions of cultural industry and creative industry are discussed below."

Jin Yuanpu (2010) furthers that CCIs are one of those industries that promote the development of the green industries and upgrade the transformation of Chinese traditional manufacturing industries. Moreover, with the involvement of highly-advanced technologies, CCIs even outperform other traditional industries with much stronger innovative advantage. Generally, Chinese scholars have put great emphasis on the importance of CCIs from the perspective of industrial reconstruction and transformation, and focused on the interrelationship among relevant industries."

The smallest circle in the model produces the copyrightable works of original value such as performing arts, literature, music, and visual arts. Outside the core creative arts, there are other core creative industries, which include film, museums, galleries, libraries and photography. In the third layer circle, the creative industries are expanded to sectors including advertising, architecture, design and fashion. The largest circle is the cultural related industries, composing of heritage services, publishing and print media, television and radio, sound recording, video and computer games. Overall, these circles are expanding from inside to outside according to their strength of creation and origination."

With the consideration of these four major determinants and two environmental elements, a country or an area's specific industrial competitiveness can be measured and evaluated in current and future development. An industry's international competitiveness may then result from responding effectively to, and building on, the determining factors at any of the various geographic levels. Hence, it is the successful combination by a particular firm or industry of particular determinants at the relevant geographic levels, that leads to international competitiveness, not an exclusive or primary focus on national or local determinants."

These factors range from endowed factors such as infrastructure and landmass to economic factors such as foreign reserves. In accordance with Michael Porter's diamond of competitive advantage, the attributes of a nation have been sectioned into four main factors: condition factors; demand; related industries; strategy."

According to Porter, it is considered that the extent of factor conditions in a country or region would lead to business opportunity recognition in certain industries, which consequently triggers entrepreneurial mindset due to the speed of knowledge transfer and access to specific resources. In other words, the companies' behavior is guided in the market or industry by the availability of resources in the environment. Therefore, entrepreneurs should maximize their knowledge and social resources like capital or social networks to prepare their mindset and find out market opportunities in specific industry."

Porter's model suggests if the local demand for a domestic product or service is greater than foreign markets, then local firms should put more emphasis on developing certain products or services than foreign firms in home market, which would create competitive advantage for the home country. Porter also places emphasis on the role of home demand in providing impetus for industry's upgrading and innovation due to the fact that domestic firms are the most sensitive to the needs of its closest customers. With this regard, domestic firms can transfer the domestic demand into their international expansion so as to compete with international competitors. In light of the available market information, potential entrepreneurs' mindset is fashioned and adapted to the existing market demand and thereby more likely to explore new ideas related with that demand. By focusing on existing market demand knowledgeable entrepreneurs can introduce new products, services, sources of input or advances that lead to increased entrepreneurial behavior. In sum, individuals with information on certain market demands or industries may recognize more entrepreneurial opportunities in these industries and markets than those who have no knowledge and no market shares on these industries."

When industries coordinate activities and form clusters of supporting industries within the value chain they achieve a competitive advantage (Porter, 1991). It is believed that the strength and competitiveness of related and supporting industries in a region or country initiates the entrepreneurial mindset in recognizing and finding out market opportunities. When local supporting industries are competitive, new entrants continue to grow in both related and supportive industries and later form clusters. Due to the transfer of information flow and transactions between buyers and sellers, firms can better think up with the most cost-effective and innovative products. Industrial clusters or related and supporting industries are critical in technology transfer and innovation (Tan, 2006, p. 842), which also facilitate cooperation, efficiency and flexibility, lower transportation and traffic costs during the producing process (Porter, 1990). The power and strength of the related and supporting industries in a region or country improves both horizontal and vertical connections and interactions within industries (Walzer, Shumway, &amp; Gruidl, 2005), what's more, it stimulates social interaction, information communication and exchange (Saxenian, 1994; Jacobs &amp; De Man, 1996; Rosenfeld, 1996). Social infrastructure inside the value chain of the related and supporting industries helps the transfer of technology and knowledge (Rosenfeld, 1997). Therefore, it is suggested that the access to social infrastructure within the related industries will encourage new ideas and new business cooperation, which will invite experimentation, enhance potential critical thinking, and lead to more business opportunities."

A stream of research found that the external environment plays a crucial factor  in creating opportunities as opportunity recognition is a process influenced by many contextual factors in the external environment (Gaglio &amp; Taub, 1992; Singh, 1998), most importantly the availability of resources (Timmons, 1994) and assorted technologies (Zahra, 2008, p. 245). Based on this reasoning, environmental contexts and technology, consumer economics, social valued and governmental regulations (Stevensen &amp; Gumpert, 1985) and changing trends in the present. In other words, entrepreneurs identify opportunities by using various information about the environment (Busenitz &amp; Barney, 1997). They make a habit of scanning their environments for information that may lead to entrepreneurial opportunities (Stewart, May, &amp; Kalia, 2008). Thus, government can influence entrepreneurs and their competitive advantages through policies and laws implemented in the markets, such as setting the production standards, compensations, subsidies and competition regulations. Although opportunities and government factor are not determinants to the competitive advantages, these two factors can indirectly influence the entrepreneurial and industrial competiveness. To conclude, an industry's international competitiveness is still mainly determined by the four factors, factors conditions, demand conditions, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry, related and supporting industries, the Porter's diamond model of national competitive advantage can be interactive and dynamic."

In his point of view, technology innovation and clustering advantage are closely related to the support of governments and related institutions, such as universities, scientific research institutions, financial institutions, legal system and social management system, they are all influential to innovation and clustering. At a regional competition level, innovation is a determinant of a region's international competitiveness. Economist Cooke holds the view that regional innovation system is made up with the manufacturing enterprises, research institutions and higher education institutions, which are separated and correlated geographically. Innovation is not only critically important for technological enterprises, but for any enterprise that wants to expand their business and maintains its sustainable international competitiveness. Hence, innovation is a new important determinant in improving international competitiveness for any country or region in the informational era, any industry that wants to maintain its sustainable competitiveness must offer financial support in escalating the level of research and development."

Similarly, the total copyright industries largely grew with an excess of 4.3% in the first two periods, and reached a peak growth rate of 5.67% in the period of 2011 to 2012.

This method was invented by Karl Pearson in 1901, and was further developed by Harold Hotelling in the 1930s. It is usually used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. The Principal Components Analysis is conducted through eigenvalue decomposition of a data matrix. The results of the analysis are usually discussed in terms of component scores, which also named factor scores (the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point), and loadings (the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score). It is one of the oldest, simplest and useful statistical method to illustrate the interrelationship of the correlated variances and provide specific assumptions for research and studies."

The overall KMO is printed in the\" KMO and Bartlett's Test\" table of the Factor Output. Generally, principal components analysis requires that the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy be greater than 0.50. KMO statistic Kaiser (1974) recommends a bare minimum of 0.5 and that values below 0.60 as unacceptable, between 0.60 and 0.70 are mediocre, values between 0.7 and 0.8 are good, values between 0.8 and 0.9 are great. For these data the value of this principal component analysis is 0.620, which is satisfied with the requirement and it is considered that the sample size is adequate for factor analysis. Besides, Bartlett's test of sphericity tests the hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identify matrix, which would indicate that the variables are unrelated and therefore unsuitable for structure detection. Small values (less than 0.01) of the significance level indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with the data. As shown in Table 5.2, the significance is 0.000, which is suitable for factor analysis."

S. music, movies, television shows, computer software, games, books and works of art could go international and keep competitive. As early as 1790, the U. S. announced and implemented the first Copyright Act, it became the earliest country which had conducted the intellectual property protection system. As the expansion of the U. S. economy, technology and social needs, the U. S. government has adapted the law and improve it in order to protect the country's cultural industries. After years of adjustments, the U. S. intellectual property system has gradually become the most detailed and widely-used law. In 1995, the Clinton Administration's Intellectual Property Working Group issued a report on Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure. This report described copyright law's past adaptation to new technologies, identified the challenges of the digital environment, and make a number of recommendations for legislative changes. In 2010, the Secretary of Commerce created the Internet Policy Task Force to provide policy coordination across the Department of Commerce, and to conduct a comprehensive review of privacy policy, copyright, global free of information, and cyber security, and their respective relationships to innovation in the internet economy. With the coming up of Contract Law and Labor Law, the federal government has provided an external law system to protect every aspect of the"

On the other hand, new media and technology has assisted the U. S. CCIs to expand internationally. These two major reasons lead to the sustainability of the U. S. CCIs among all the countries. Since 2002, its consumer spending on the arts and culture products has remained in the $150 million range. Even in a slow economy during 2008 to 2009, the U. S. CCIs continued to grow steadily. In 2011, the value added from arts and cultural production accounted for almost 3.2%, or $504 billion of the U. S. GDP. Over two million workers were employed in the American cultural industries, accounting for 2.1% of all U. S. jobs. Up to 2013, the America's contribution of CCIs to its GDP has increased to 11.12%, devoting over one trillion dollars of value added to the national economy. It is concluded that the U. S.

In the first place, foreign scholars mainly focus on general definitions, classifications, and features of the CCIs. They center on the elaboration of copyright system and specific sectors, such as film industry and music industry, and use economic indicators or models to describe the CCIs. While Chinese scholars concentrate more on studying theories and cases, including the clustering theory of CCIs, the competitiveness theories, and comparative studies between developed countries and China, among which most of the studies are qualitative analysis. Secondly, foreign scholars attach much more emphasis on the industrial structure and economic value held in American CCIs.

Hence, a systematic study on main countries' CCIs is necessary. The author aims to combine both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis in this thesis.

Adorno's later works on film, radio, newspapers and music all reaffirmed the opinion that monopoly capitalism had become thoroughly absorbed by the economy (Huyssen, 1986; Adorno 1991). With the growth of capital economy, culture industry gradually involved into the economy and turned into a new individual industry. Adorno equates the American cultural industry with European Fascism ((Huyssen, 1986, p. 23) that the modern worker has been totally integrated into the industrial machine he now has his leisure time and his interiority controlled by modern industrial techniques. The Fordist factory system moved into the realm of culture used as a powerful ideological tool.

Although Adorno's idea about the cultural industries is negative, it still caused attention and became an important basis for future study. Later, scholars in Fordist school considered that the original capital collection were seen as the foundation for the development of cultural industries, most of the producers aimed to maximize their profits in order to satisfy customers' needs and wants. This view illustrates the positive side of the cultural industries and it has considered the market and consumers' needs for the first time, which is different from Adorno's idea. Granham (1987, p. 25) argued that this\" materialism\" tended to be both too much and not enough. To materialist in the sense that culture was seen to be completely reducible to the needs of\" capital\" or the\" ruling class\"; not materialist enough in the sense that, once stated, there was no examination of how this culture got produces, by whom and under what conditions. The central contention of the political economy school was that under capitalism culture was increasingly produced as a commodity, and thus subject to the logic and the contradictions of this system of production (O' Connor, 2010, p. 23)."

The concept also gained policy purchase in Taiwan, Korea, and in the hybrid form of\" cultural creative industries\" in"

Cultural industries connect the inputs such as creativity and the outputs like aesthetic or intangible experience as a distinctive feature in the market. Galloway and Dunlop (2006, p.28) refer that any business or activity based on creativity can be considered as a creative industry. While, several famous authors (Higgs, Cunningham, &amp; Bakhshi, 2008) point out that measurable data and statistics work are more scientific in directing governments than theories and concepts. As the growing influence of internet and digital media, scholars start to focus on the significance of technologies on CCIs. Daniel Bell thinks that the information society has only limited influence, with most accounts of the creative industries being considerably more circumspect about proclaiming a postindustrial utopia for the creative workforce, and there has been considerable recognition of the question of precarious labor that often underpin contract employment and flexible working arrangements (Deuze, 2006; Cunningham, 2008). While other scholars like Hesmondhalgh, Miller and Kellner all hold positive view, they think the technologies should be maximized and combined with CCIs. Overall, foreign studies on CCIs have provided much reference for governments and organizations on developing their cultural industries."

After 1980s, with the adoption of Marxism, Chinese academic scholars started researching on the Frankfurt theory on cultural economies and cultural industries, which has became the foundation of domestic research of cultural industries. Although China is a nation with long history and resourceful culture, Chinese CCIs have a shorter history of development and cannot compete with other western countries yet. In recent years, Chinese scholars have been trying to find out what is the most appropriate model for Chinese CCIs from many aspects, including from the view of strategy, international trade and business, clustering theory and regional development, policy-making, investment and financial model, cities' competitiveness, intellectual property right, and comparison between Chinese and Western culture. Today, the cultural industries have become one of the major economic talking points of China's social and economic development, and cultural consumption has started to become a feature that permeates all of people's lives on a daily basis.

According to his idea, there are two kinds of creativity: the kind that relates to people's fulfillment as individuals and the kind that generates a product. The first one is a universal characteristic of humanity and is found in all societies and cultures. The second is stronger in industrial societies, which put a higher value on novelty, on science and technological innovation, and on intellectual property rights (IPRs)."

Similarly, according to authors (Cunningham, 2002; Hesmondhalgh, 2002; Markusen, 2008), there is an distinction between cultural industries and creative industries, the creative economy has a broader sector of industries than cultural economy, including those purely cultural activities like science, engineering, computing and education which are excluded by cultural industries. Another major distinction mentioned by Galloway and Dunlop (2007) is the production of culture and meaning. Cultural economist David Throsby (2008) has noticed the distinction between cultural and creative industries come from the definitional difficulties in differentiating\" culture\" and\" creativity\" (Throsby 2008, p. 229). Definitions of cultural industry and creative industry are discussed below."

Zhang Jingcheng (2006) quotes that CCIs is a newly-emerging industries that are operated on the basis of post-industrialization and involved with both creative activities and traditional manufacturing industries. Jin Yuanpu (2010) furthers that CCIs are one of those industries that promote the development of the green industries and upgrade the transformation of Chinese traditional manufacturing industries. Moreover, with the involvement of highly-advanced technologies, CCIs even outperform other traditional industries with much stronger innovative advantage. Generally, Chinese scholars have put great emphasis on the importance of CCIs from the perspective of industrial reconstruction and transformation, and focused on the interrelationship among relevant industries."

As presented in Figure 3.2, the circles represent those industries that focus mainly or particularly on the commercialization of pure expressive value of the CCIs, such as music, television, radio, publishing, computer games and film. The smallest circle in the model produces the copyrightable works of original value such as performing arts, literature, music, and visual arts. Outside the core creative arts, there are other core creative industries, which include film, museums, galleries, libraries and photography. In the third layer circle, the creative industries are expanded to sectors including advertising, architecture, design and fashion. The largest circle is the cultural related industries, composing of heritage services, publishing and print media, television and radio, sound recording, video and computer games. Overall, these circles are expanding from inside to outside according to their strength of creation and origination."

WEF defined competitiveness as\" the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country\" in the Global Competitiveness Report of 1997. In the same year of 1997, IMD defined competitiveness as a country's ability to create more wealth than its competitors in the international market. Both of these two institutes created evaluation indexes to measure a nation's competitiveness. These indexes are relevant to market openness, government management, financial situation, infrastructure, enterprises management, science and technology, and citizen quality. Each year, the global competitiveness reports released by these two institutions attract lots of attention, and their studies have become important reference for all the countries and governments."

With the consideration of these four major determinants and two environmental elements, a country or an area's specific industrial competitiveness can be measured and evaluated in current and future development. An industry's international competitiveness may then result from responding effectively to, and building on, the determining factors at any of the various geographic levels. Hence, it is the successful combination by a particular firm or industry of particular determinants at the relevant geographic levels, that leads to international competitiveness, not an exclusive or primary focus on national or local determinants."

According to Porter, it is considered that the extent of factor conditions in a country or region would lead to business opportunity recognition in certain industries, which consequently triggers entrepreneurial mindset due to the speed of knowledge transfer and access to specific resources. In other words, the companies' behavior is guided in the market or industry by the availability of resources in the environment.

Porter also places emphasis on the role of home demand in providing impetus for industry's upgrading and innovation due to the fact that domestic firms are the most sensitive to the needs of its closest customers. With this regard, domestic firms can transfer the domestic demand into their international expansion so as to compete with international competitors. In light of the available market information, potential entrepreneurs' mindset is fashioned and adapted to the existing market demand and thereby more likely to explore new ideas related with that demand. By focusing on existing market demand knowledgeable entrepreneurs can introduce new products, services, sources of input or advances that lead to increased entrepreneurial behavior. In sum, individuals with information on certain market demands or industries may recognize more entrepreneurial opportunities in these industries and markets than those who have no knowledge and no market shares on these industries."

When industries coordinate activities and form clusters of supporting industries within the value chain they achieve a competitive advantage (Porter, 1991). It is believed that the strength and competitiveness of related and supporting industries in a region or country initiates the entrepreneurial mindset in recognizing and finding out market opportunities. When local supporting industries are competitive, new entrants continue to grow in both related and supportive industries and later form clusters. Due to the transfer of information flow and transactions between buyers and sellers, firms can better think up with the most cost-effective and innovative products. Industrial clusters or related and supporting industries are critical in technology transfer and innovation (Tan, 2006, p. 842), which also facilitate cooperation, efficiency and flexibility, lower transportation and traffic costs during the producing process (Porter, 1990). The power and strength of the related and supporting industries in a region or country improves both horizontal and vertical connections and interactions within industries (Walzer, Shumway, &amp; Gruidl, 2005), what's more, it stimulates social interaction, information communication and exchange (Saxenian, 1994; Jacobs &amp; De Man, 1996; Rosenfeld, 1996). Social infrastructure inside the value chain of the related and supporting industries helps the transfer of technology and knowledge (Rosenfeld, 1997). Therefore, it is suggested that the access to social infrastructure within the related industries will encourage new ideas and new business cooperation, which will invite experimentation, enhance potential critical thinking, and lead to more business opportunities."

A stream of research found that the external environment plays a crucial factor  in creating opportunities as opportunity recognition is a process influenced by many contextual factors in the external environment (Gaglio &amp; Taub, 1992; Singh, 1998), most importantly the availability of resources (Timmons, 1994) and assorted technologies (Zahra, 2008, p. 245). Based on this reasoning, environmental contexts and technology, consumer economics, social valued and governmental regulations (Stevensen &amp; Gumpert, 1985) and changing trends in the present. In other words, entrepreneurs identify opportunities by using various information about the environment (Busenitz &amp; Barney, 1997). They make a habit of scanning their environments for information that may lead to entrepreneurial opportunities (Stewart, May, &amp; Kalia, 2008). Thus, government can influence entrepreneurs and their competitive advantages through policies and laws implemented in the markets, such as setting the production standards, compensations, subsidies and competition regulations. Although opportunities and government factor are not determinants to the competitive advantages, these two factors can indirectly influence the entrepreneurial and industrial competiveness. To conclude, an industry's international competitiveness is still mainly determined by the four factors, factors conditions, demand conditions, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry, related and supporting industries, the Porter's diamond model of national competitive advantage can be interactive and dynamic."

Therefore, with traditional production elements weakening, knowledge innovation, technology innovation are leading and strengthening, innovation becomes the basic characteristic of modern economic development. As CCIs such as film and animation industries emphasize more on innovation and innovation, innovation could be a variable in the new diamond model and a critical element in the whole business operating model.

In his point of view, innovation is the root reason of industrial changes occur, economic cycles vary, and the main source of economic growth. Thus, innovation has become a major factor for any country or region to increase and maintain its international competitiveness and innovation can be added into Porter's diamond model.

At a regional competition level, innovation is a determinant of a region's international competitiveness. Economist Cooke holds the view that regional innovation system is made up with the manufacturing enterprises, research institutions and higher education institutions, which are separated and correlated geographically. Innovation is not only critically important for technological enterprises, but for any enterprise that wants to expand their business and maintains its sustainable international competitiveness. Hence, innovation is a new important determinant in improving international competitiveness for any country or region in the informational era, any industry that wants to maintain its sustainable competitiveness must offer financial support in escalating the level of research and development."

As shown in Figure 4.2.7, the global box office for all films released in all countries reached $35.0 billion in 2013, up four percent of the 2012. The increase was result to the rising box office of the U.S. box office, which is up 33% over five years ago. In the year of 2013, U.S. box office was $10.9 billion, up one percent from $10.8 billion in 2012, and up three percent from 2009. It is seen that the U.S. box office accounts for the largest global box office in the international movie industries, and the portion keeps growing year by year with stronger growing impetus. All this are result to the fact that the U.S. CCIs have been upgrading the industries by consistently innovating the technology and expanding the overseas markets. See Figure 4.2.7and Table 4.2.8."

This method was invented by Karl Pearson in 1901, and was further developed by Harold Hotelling in the 1930s. It is usually used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. The Principal Components Analysis is conducted through eigenvalue decomposition of a data matrix. The results of the analysis are usually discussed in terms of component scores, which also named factor scores (the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point), and loadings (the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score). It is one of the oldest, simplest and useful statistical method to illustrate the interrelationship of the correlated variances and provide specific assumptions for research and studies."

The overall KMO is printed in the\" KMO and Bartlett's Test\" table of the Factor Output. Generally, principal components analysis requires that the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy be greater than 0.50. KMO statistic Kaiser (1974) recommends a bare minimum of 0.5 and that values below 0.60 as unacceptable, between 0.60 and 0.70 are mediocre, values between 0.7 and 0.8 are good, values between 0.8 and 0.9 are great. For these data the value of this principal component analysis is 0.620, which is satisfied with the requirement and it is considered that the sample size is adequate for factor analysis. Besides, Bartlett's test of sphericity tests the hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identify matrix, which would indicate that the variables are unrelated and therefore unsuitable for structure detection. Small values (less than 0.01) of the significance level indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with the data. As shown in Table 5.2, the significance is 0.000, which is suitable for factor analysis."

S. music, movies, television shows, computer software, games, books and works of art could go international and keep competitive. As early as 1790, the U. S. announced and implemented the first Copyright Act, it became the earliest country which had conducted the intellectual property protection system. As the expansion of the U. S. economy, technology and social needs, the U. S. government has adapted the law and improve it in order to protect the country's cultural industries. After years of adjustments, the U. S. intellectual property system has gradually become the most detailed and widely-used law. In 1995, the Clinton Administration's Intellectual Property Working Group issued a report on Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure. This report described copyright law's past adaptation to new technologies, identified the challenges of the digital environment, and make a number of recommendations for legislative changes. In 2010, the Secretary of Commerce created the Internet Policy Task Force to provide policy coordination across the Department of Commerce, and to conduct a comprehensive review of privacy policy, copyright, global free of information, and cyber security, and their respective relationships to innovation in the internet economy.

In 2011, the value added from arts and cultural production accounted for almost 3.2%, or $504 billion of the U. S. GDP. Over two million workers were employed in the American cultural industries, accounting for 2.1% of all U. S. jobs. Up to 2013, the America's contribution of CCIs to its GDP has increased to 11.12%, devoting over one trillion dollars of value added to the national economy. It is concluded that the U. S. CCIs are of the most valuable industries and they have been substantially expanding at a high speed, such as American films, music, news, arts, sports, food, and etc."

The number was a large increase from $965 billion in 2011 and $885 billion in 2009, according to research released by the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA). In 2012, nearly five and a half million U.

With the purpose to find out reasons leading to the success of the U. S. CCIs, 26 countries' competitiveness of their CCIs is compared and contrast. As a result, conclusions can be made by the comparison and analysis of 26 countries' CCIs."

The Fordist factory system moved into the realm of culture used as a powerful ideological tool.

Although Adorno's idea about the cultural industries is negative, it still caused attention and became an important basis for future study. Later, scholars in Fordist school considered that the original capital collection were seen as the foundation for the development of cultural industries, most of the producers aimed to maximize their profits in order to satisfy customers' needs and wants. This view illustrates the positive side of the cultural industries and it has considered the market and consumers' needs for the first time, which is different from Adorno's idea. Granham (1987, p. 25) argued that this\" materialism\" tended to be both too much and not enough. To materialist in the sense that culture was seen to be completely reducible to the needs of\" capital\" or the\" ruling class\"; not materialist enough in the sense that, once stated, there was no examination of how this culture got produces, by whom and under what conditions. The central contention of the political economy school was that under capitalism culture was increasingly produced as a commodity, and thus subject to the logic and the contradictions of this system of production (O' Connor, 2010, p. 23)."

Cultural industries connect the inputs such as creativity and the outputs like aesthetic or intangible experience as a distinctive feature in the market. Galloway and Dunlop (2006, p.28) refer that any business or activity based on creativity can be considered as a creative industry. While, several famous authors (Higgs, Cunningham, &amp; Bakhshi, 2008) point out that measurable data and statistics work are more scientific in directing governments than theories and concepts. As the growing influence of internet and digital media, scholars start to focus on the significance of technologies on CCIs. Daniel Bell thinks that the information society has only limited influence, with most accounts of the creative industries being considerably more circumspect about proclaiming a postindustrial utopia for the creative workforce, and there has been considerable recognition of the question of precarious labor that often underpin contract employment and flexible working arrangements (Deuze, 2006; Cunningham, 2008). While other scholars like Hesmondhalgh, Miller and Kellner all hold positive view, they think the technologies should be maximized and combined with CCIs. Overall, foreign studies on CCIs have provided much reference for governments and organizations on developing their cultural industries."

Although China is a nation with long history and resourceful culture, Chinese CCIs have a shorter history of development and cannot compete with other western countries yet.

According to his idea, there are two kinds of creativity: the kind that relates to people's fulfillment as individuals and the kind that generates a product. The first one is a universal characteristic of humanity and is found in all societies and cultures. The second is stronger in industrial societies, which put a higher value on novelty, on science and technological innovation, and on intellectual property rights (IPRs)."

Similarly, according to authors (Cunningham, 2002; Hesmondhalgh, 2002; Markusen, 2008), there is an distinction between cultural industries and creative industries, the creative economy has a broader sector of industries than cultural economy, including those purely cultural activities like science, engineering, computing and education which are excluded by cultural industries. Another major distinction mentioned by Galloway and Dunlop (2007) is the production of culture and meaning. Cultural economist David Throsby (2008) has noticed the distinction between cultural and creative industries come from the definitional difficulties in differentiating\" culture\" and\" creativity\" (Throsby 2008, p. 229). Definitions of cultural industry and creative industry are discussed below."

Jin Yuanpu (2010) furthers that CCIs are one of those industries that promote the development of the green industries and upgrade the transformation of Chinese traditional manufacturing industries. Moreover, with the involvement of highly-advanced technologies, CCIs even outperform other traditional industries with much stronger innovative advantage. Generally, Chinese scholars have put great emphasis on the importance of CCIs from the perspective of industrial reconstruction and transformation, and focused on the interrelationship among relevant industries."

The smallest circle in the model produces the copyrightable works of original value such as performing arts, literature, music, and visual arts. Outside the core creative arts, there are other core creative industries, which include film, museums, galleries, libraries and photography. In the third layer circle, the creative industries are expanded to sectors including advertising, architecture, design and fashion. The largest circle is the cultural related industries, composing of heritage services, publishing and print media, television and radio, sound recording, video and computer games. Overall, these circles are expanding from inside to outside according to their strength of creation and origination."

WEF defined competitiveness as\" the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country\" in the Global Competitiveness Report of 1997. In the same year of 1997, IMD defined competitiveness as a country's ability to create more wealth than its competitors in the international market. Both of these two institutes created evaluation indexes to measure a nation's competitiveness. These indexes are relevant to market openness, government management, financial situation, infrastructure, enterprises management, science and technology, and citizen quality. Each year, the global competitiveness reports released by these two institutions attract lots of attention, and their studies have become important reference for all the countries and governments."

With the consideration of these four major determinants and two environmental elements, a country or an area's specific industrial competitiveness can be measured and evaluated in current and future development. An industry's international competitiveness may then result from responding effectively to, and building on, the determining factors at any of the various geographic levels. Hence, it is the successful combination by a particular firm or industry of particular determinants at the relevant geographic levels, that leads to international competitiveness, not an exclusive or primary focus on national or local determinants."

These factors range from endowed factors such as infrastructure and landmass to economic factors such as foreign reserves. In accordance with Michael Porter's diamond of competitive advantage, the attributes of a nation have been sectioned into four main factors: condition factors; demand; related industries; strategy."

According to Porter, it is considered that the extent of factor conditions in a country or region would lead to business opportunity recognition in certain industries, which consequently triggers entrepreneurial mindset due to the speed of knowledge transfer and access to specific resources. In other words, the companies' behavior is guided in the market or industry by the availability of resources in the environment.

Porter also places emphasis on the role of home demand in providing impetus for industry's upgrading and innovation due to the fact that domestic firms are the most sensitive to the needs of its closest customers. With this regard, domestic firms can transfer the domestic demand into their international expansion so as to compete with international competitors. In light of the available market information, potential entrepreneurs' mindset is fashioned and adapted to the existing market demand and thereby more likely to explore new ideas related with that demand. By focusing on existing market demand knowledgeable entrepreneurs can introduce new products, services, sources of input or advances that lead to increased entrepreneurial behavior. In sum, individuals with information on certain market demands or industries may recognize more entrepreneurial opportunities in these industries and markets than those who have no knowledge and no market shares on these industries."

When industries coordinate activities and form clusters of supporting industries within the value chain they achieve a competitive advantage (Porter, 1991). It is believed that the strength and competitiveness of related and supporting industries in a region or country initiates the entrepreneurial mindset in recognizing and finding out market opportunities. When local supporting industries are competitive, new entrants continue to grow in both related and supportive industries and later form clusters. Due to the transfer of information flow and transactions between buyers and sellers, firms can better think up with the most cost-effective and innovative products. Industrial clusters or related and supporting industries are critical in technology transfer and innovation (Tan, 2006, p. 842), which also facilitate cooperation, efficiency and flexibility, lower transportation and traffic costs during the producing process (Porter, 1990). The power and strength of the related and supporting industries in a region or country improves both horizontal and vertical connections and interactions within industries (Walzer, Shumway, &amp; Gruidl, 2005), what's more, it stimulates social interaction, information communication and exchange (Saxenian, 1994; Jacobs &amp; De Man, 1996; Rosenfeld, 1996). Social infrastructure inside the value chain of the related and supporting industries helps the transfer of technology and knowledge (Rosenfeld, 1997). Therefore, it is suggested that the access to social infrastructure within the related industries will encourage new ideas and new business cooperation, which will invite experimentation, enhance potential critical thinking, and lead to more business opportunities."

A stream of research found that the external environment plays a crucial factor  in creating opportunities as opportunity recognition is a process influenced by many contextual factors in the external environment (Gaglio &amp; Taub, 1992; Singh, 1998), most importantly the availability of resources (Timmons, 1994) and assorted technologies (Zahra, 2008, p. 245). Based on this reasoning, environmental contexts and technology, consumer economics, social valued and governmental regulations (Stevensen &amp; Gumpert, 1985) and changing trends in the present. In other words, entrepreneurs identify opportunities by using various information about the environment (Busenitz &amp; Barney, 1997). They make a habit of scanning their environments for information that may lead to entrepreneurial opportunities (Stewart, May, &amp; Kalia, 2008). Thus, government can influence entrepreneurs and their competitive advantages through policies and laws implemented in the markets, such as setting the production standards, compensations, subsidies and competition regulations. Although opportunities and government factor are not determinants to the competitive advantages, these two factors can indirectly influence the entrepreneurial and industrial competiveness. To conclude, an industry's international competitiveness is still mainly determined by the four factors, factors conditions, demand conditions, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry, related and supporting industries, the Porter's diamond model of national competitive advantage can be interactive and dynamic."

In his point of view, innovation is the root reason of industrial changes occur, economic cycles vary, and the main source of economic growth.

At a regional competition level, innovation is a determinant of a region's international competitiveness. Economist Cooke holds the view that regional innovation system is made up with the manufacturing enterprises, research institutions and higher education institutions, which are separated and correlated geographically. Innovation is not only critically important for technological enterprises, but for any enterprise that wants to expand their business and maintains its sustainable international competitiveness. Hence, innovation is a new important determinant in improving international competitiveness for any country or region in the informational era, any industry that wants to maintain its sustainable competitiveness must offer financial support in escalating the level of research and development."

The increase was result to the rising box office of the U.S. box office, which is up 33% over five years ago. In the year of 2013, U.S. box office was $10.9 billion, up one percent from $10.8 billion in 2012, and up three percent from 2009. It is seen that the U.S. box office accounts for the largest global box office in the international movie industries, and the portion keeps growing year by year with stronger growing impetus.

It is usually used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. The Principal Components Analysis is conducted through eigenvalue decomposition of a data matrix. The results of the analysis are usually discussed in terms of component scores, which also named factor scores (the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point), and loadings (the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score). It is one of the oldest, simplest and useful statistical method to illustrate the interrelationship of the correlated variances and provide specific assumptions for research and studies."

The overall KMO is printed in the\" KMO and Bartlett's Test\" table of the Factor Output. Generally, principal components analysis requires that the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy be greater than 0.50. KMO statistic Kaiser (1974) recommends a bare minimum of 0.5 and that values below 0.60 as unacceptable, between 0.60 and 0.70 are mediocre, values between 0.7 and 0.8 are good, values between 0.8 and 0.9 are great. For these data the value of this principal component analysis is 0.620, which is satisfied with the requirement and it is considered that the sample size is adequate for factor analysis. Besides, Bartlett's test of sphericity tests the hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identify matrix, which would indicate that the variables are unrelated and therefore unsuitable for structure detection. Small values (less than 0.01) of the significance level indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with the data. As shown in Table 5.2, the significance is 0.000, which is suitable for factor analysis."

S. economy, technology and social needs, the U. S. government has adapted the law and improve it in order to protect the country's cultural industries. After years of adjustments, the U. S. intellectual property system has gradually become the most detailed and widely-used law. In 1995, the Clinton Administration's Intellectual Property Working Group issued a report on Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure. This report described copyright law's past adaptation to new technologies, identified the challenges of the digital environment, and make a number of recommendations for legislative changes. In 2010, the Secretary of Commerce created the Internet Policy Task Force to provide policy coordination across the Department of Commerce, and to conduct a comprehensive review of privacy policy, copyright, global free of information, and cyber security, and their respective relationships to innovation in the internet economy.

From movies made by Hollywood, such as the animated movie Kongfu Panda with the promotion of Tai Chi philosophy and the animated movie Mulan based on Chinese ancient story, many movies contained Chinese culture became huge success and are very popular in the world. Therefore, traditional culture and arts should be brought into the global market with utmost effort, either through movies, books, conference, language schools, shows and performance, music and so forth. All of the resourceful cultural elements can be transformed into business products and service, which would help Chinese culture go abroad and generate huge influence when competing with foreign culture."
